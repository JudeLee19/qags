{"data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Between 2012 and 2015, cases of syphilis increased by 76%, from 3,001 to 5,288, while gonorrhoea infections rose by 53%, from 26,880 to 41,193, Public Health England data reveals. The rise was notable among men who have sex with men. At the same time, rates of genital warts decreased, thanks to a vaccination campaign. Rates of sexually transmitted infections as a group also went down slightly, totalling 434,456. But experts say this could be because fewer people came forward for testing. Chlamydia was the most commonly diagnosed STI, accounting for nearly half of the cases diagnosed in 2015. Young people are routinely offered chlamydia screening, but only 13% of young men and 32% of young women were tested in 2015. The large fall in genital warts - a 7% drop - was seen in young women, and experts say this was probably because of the national human papilloma virus vaccination programme. All girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the jab as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The FPA charity's chief executive, Natika Halil, said boys should be offered the vaccine too, which is something ministers are considering. Genevieve Edwards, of Marie Stopes UK, said the statistics should \"set alarm bells ringing\" about the availability of sexual health services for young people and men who have sex with men. \"We have to keep a focus on preventing sexual ill health, and providing prompt diagnosis and treatment to those who need it,\" she added. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the continued rise of gonorrhoea was extremely disturbing, given the further spread of drug-resistant infections. Dr Gwenda Hughes, head of STI surveillance at PHE, said: \"We need to do more to raise awareness about STIs and how they can be prevented, especially the effectiveness of using condoms. \"We recommend that anyone having sex with a new or casual partner uses condoms and tests regularly for HIV and STIs.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Where are cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea rising in ?", "answers": [], "id": 0}, {"question": "In the past five years , how many cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea have there been ?", "answers": [], "id": 1}, {"question": "In the last five years , how many cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea have there been ?", "answers": [], "id": 2}, {"question": "Where has syphilis and gonorrhoea been increasing in the past five years ?", "answers": [], "id": 3}, {"question": "Over what period have cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea risen sharply ?", "answers": [], "id": 4}, {"question": "Along with gonorrhoea , what infection has had a sharp rise in cases in England over the past five years ?", "answers": [], "id": 5}, {"question": "Along with gonorrhoea , what infection has risen in England over the past five years ?", "answers": [], "id": 6}, {"question": "Along with gonorrhoea , what infection has had a sharp rise in cases in England in the past five years ?", "answers": [], "id": 7}, {"question": "Over what time period have cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea risen sharply ?", "answers": [], "id": 8}, {"question": "Along with gonorrhoea , what infection has its incidence risen sharply in England over the past five years ?", "answers": [], "id": 9}]}], "title": "Between 2012 and 2015, cases"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Driver Henry McPherson, 61, from St Fergus, died after the accident on the A952 near Mintlaw in 2014.

The boy was handed an eight-year sentence - and the supervision - for the killing, and another year for weapons offences. He will begin serving his sentence in a young offenders institution because of his age.

Aberdeen City Council said the case had been \"devastating\" for the families affected and staff and pupils at Cults Academy.

Tudur Owen, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the cat had also bitten and scratched other members of staff. Colleagues had penned the cat under a fridge using chopping boards. Edwards and a colleague entered the kitchen saying \"we're going to have to kill the cat\" and came out with the animal inside a black bag, carrying a piece of wood and saying \"we'll have to put it out of its misery\". The court heard the pair were challenged by another colleague but Edwards was concerned the cat would return if they chased it away and said to her: \"We don't have a choice.\" There had been a furious local backlash following the cat's death and an online petition calling for those responsible to be prosecuted attracted more than 35,700 supporters. Melissa Griffiths, defending, said Edwards had been dismissed from his job after 32 years working at the hotel. \"He's been vilified since and has become a hermit in his own home, afraid to go out because of the strength of feeling against him,\" said Ms Griffiths. \"He's been verbally abused and refused service in his local village.

The figure was weaker than the 5% growth in the third quarter of 2014. However, the dramatic slide in fuel prices in recent months has put more money in consumers' pockets and allowed them to spend more. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, rose by 4.3% in the fourth quarter - the fastest rise in nearly nine years - and higher than the 3.2% for the third quarter. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said: \"It took us a while to get here, but I think the economy is finally off and running. \"We are seeing a number of positive developments. Businesses are hiring aggressively and the big drop in gas prices means that people have more money to spend on other items.\" The near-60% slide in oil prices in the plast seven months has cut the price of petrol to about $2 per gallon, or the equivalent of \u00c2\u00a31.32 for 4.5 litres. That is little more than British drivers pay for just one litre of petrol. The fall has saved Americans about $175bn, Mr Zandi said: \"A big part of growth this year will be people spending their gas savings.\" For 2014 as a whole, the economy expanded by 2.4% - better than the 2.2% for the previous 12 months.

Some economists believe an increase could come in middle of the year, but Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said Friday's data could delay a rise until late this year or even early 2016. He feared that the US economy was too reliant on consumer spending given that business investment fell by an annualised rate of 1.9% - the biggest decline since the second quarter of 2009. \"Ideally, a sustainable economic upturn requires business spending to be rising alongside consumer expenditure.\" \"While Markit's Flash PMI survey data signalled a further robust expansion of private sector business activity in January, the latest reading was the second weakest for 11 months and points to GDP growth sliding to 2% in the first quarter,\" Mr Williamson added. \"Companies also reported the weakest monthly increase in new orders since the recession, suggesting the pace of economic growth could weaken even further in February.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What grew at a slower pace than expected in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 180}, {"question": "When did the US economy grow at a slower pace than expected ?", "answers": [], "id": 181}, {"question": "What country 's economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 182}, {"question": "When did the US economy grow at a slower-than-expected pace ?", "answers": [], "id": 183}, {"question": "Did the U.S. economy grow at a faster or slower pace than expected in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 184}, {"question": "Which country 's economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 185}, {"question": "What part of 2014 did the economy grow at a slower pace than expected ?", "answers": [], "id": 186}, {"question": "Did the US economy grow at a faster or slower pace than expected in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 187}, {"question": "What did not grow at a slower pace in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 188}, {"question": "What stalled out at a slower pace than expected in the final three months of 2014 ?", "answers": [], "id": 189}]}], "title": "The US posted annualised growth"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The local authority has spent more than \u00a3750,000 on events since 2014.

Brown, of Brockley Rise, south-east London, appeared via video link from Broadmoor Hospital during the hearing. A jury found Brown not guilty following a two-day trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was also found not guilty, by reason of insanity, of possession of an offensive weapon and of assault by beating of Mr Ali. The trial heard Brown had been delusional in his belief he would \"save humanity\" and exorcise a Muslim demon haunting him by stabbing his victim. The court was told he was heard by other passengers to say \"Where are all the Muslims? I am going to kill all the Muslims\", before holding a knife to the throat of another woman, who was unhurt. Brown accepted carrying out the attack but pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. Mr Ali had been travelling home with his wife when the assault took place between Honor Oak Park and Forest Hill, south London.

The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday's report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. It said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent\". While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont's Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe\". \"Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added. Last year, a separate review into the issue concluded that sexual exploitation was a growing threat to young people in Northern Ireland.

President Barack Obama has ordered a complete review of the hacks, which targeted emails at the Democratic Party and the emails of a key aide to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign. Senior Republicans have now joined Democrats in calling for a full investigation. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a joint statement on Sunday with top Democrats that the CIA's report \"should alarm every American\". He said in an interview that the congressional investigation should be more thorough than the one ordered by the White House. In October, US government officials pointed the finger at Russia, accusing it of meddling in the campaign to undermine the electoral process. But on Friday, the intelligence community went further when US media reports said the CIA had \"high confidence\" that Russians were trying to influence the election in Mr Trump's favour. Russians had hacked the Republican party but chose not to reveal the contents of what they found, the reports said. But Mr Trump told Fox News Sunday: \"I think it's ridiculous.

While backing the Obama review, the president-elect warned that it should not pin the blame solely on Russia but on other countries or individuals too. Republican party spokesman Sean Spicer said the party had not been hacked and the intelligence report was wrong.

Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the A&E department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection.

Mr Persky, a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County, California, has reportedly received death threats in the wake of the case. The jail sentence he handed down to Turner has been widely criticised as too lenient. Prosecutors had called for six years. Turner was seen by two other students sexually assaulting his victim, now 23, behind an outdoor rubbish bin. He tried to flee the scene but was caught and later admitted to the assault in court. Rights activists and members of the general public have accused Mr Persky of being influenced by Turner's upbringing in a wealthy, white family, and his achievements as a college swimmer. The petition, posted on Change.org, says that Mr Persky had \"failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors\". The judge said in his remarks that he was concerned about the \"severe impact\" a longer sentence would have on Turner's life. Turner's father was also criticised after issuing a statement to the court saying his son was paying a steep price for only \"20 minutes of action\". Turner, who was a promising swimmer expected to compete for the US at Olympic level, has been banned for life by USA Swimming, the governing body for professional swimming in the US.

That was extended early in the second period when Miles Storey's effort found the net via the post before Josh Meekings side-footed a third.

It was an unusually abject performance from the Glasgow Jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left. Media playback is not supported on this device. The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for Caley Thistle boss John Hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract Partick players. One of them is Steven Lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by Ryan Edwards. Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at Firhill since 16 January, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in Maryhill. Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo released Tremarco. At first it seemed the Englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot. Sean Welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving Owain Fon Williams in the Inverness goalmouth soon after. Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley Thistle immediately extended their lead when Meekings found Storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle. The Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon. When Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos. Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness. Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event.

Any traumatic event has the potential to lead to PTSD including:. People will be generally affected within one month of the event. There is no blood test for PTSD, it instead relies on the judgement of a doctor speaking to their patient about their symptoms. There must have been an initial traumatic event involving a close brush with death or serious violence. There are then four criteria which must be present:. \"This has to impair day-to-day function,\" said Neil Greenberg, a defence professor of mental health at the King's College London. \"With properly skilled doctors it can be very easy to diagnose, it could take a few hours,\" says Prof Greenberg. But he says doctors must have a good suspicion of PTSD before starting to diagnose someone, as patients may not bring up their trauma history. It can also be a challenge because some people deliberately \"overinflate symptoms\", sometimes for financial reasons, while others seek to avoid the stigma of a PTSD diagnosis. For many people, the symptoms will go away within a month - but others will need psychotherapy or, if that fails, medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy can help change the way people think about the traumatic event in order to control fear and anxiety. This involves going through the event in detail with a therapist. Antidepressants, such as paroxetine, are used if psychotherapy does not work.

The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. He has been identified only as Sergej W, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 April, Borussia Dortmund's home Champions League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast \"significant doubt\" on jihadist motivations being behind it.

In a statement on Friday (in German), the German federal prosecutor's office said he has German and Russian nationality. He was arrested on Friday near Tubingen in Rottenburg, south-west Germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at \u20ac78,000 (\u00a365,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack. He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team's L'Arriv\u00e9e hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 April using an IP address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money.

The meetings with his European counterparts come on the day that a new campaign to get the UK to leave the European Union is being launched ahead of the in-out referendum, promised by 2017. Vote Leave, made up of Conservative, Labour and UKIP MPs and donors, says it wants to negotiate a new deal based on free trade and friendly co-operation. Mr Cameron has pledged to reform Britain's relationship with the EU before holding a vote on membership and will discuss his aims with Mrs Merkel as part of his continuing negotiations with European leaders. The pair will also discuss the migrant crisis affecting Europe, as European countries continue to struggle to cope with the influx of people reaching the continent from the Middle East and Africa. Russia's bombing campaign in Syria is also likely to be raised at the meeting, as concerns grow about Moscow's involvement in the war-torn country - as well as its backing for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. During talks with the PM at Downing Street, Estonian Prime Minister Mr Roivas thanked Mr Cameron for the UK's commitment to send 100 British military personnel to the Baltic region. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has said the troops will deter Russian aggression beyond Ukraine and reassure eastern European Nato members.

Official celebrations are planned, as well as large protests from pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps. Several well-known activists were arrested on the eve of Mr Xi's arrival. The group, which included student leader Joshua Wong, had staged a protest at an iconic sculpture symbolising the handover. The golden sculpture of a bauhinia flower - Hong Kong's emblem - by the city's harbour was a gift from China. Mr Xi arrived for the three-day visit with his wife Peng Liyuan at the city's main Chek Lap Kok airport. The couple were welcomed by a marching band and children waving flags. In a brief speech on the tarmac, he said Hong Kong was \"always in my heart\". Beijing's central government \"has always been a strong backer of Hong Kong\" and \"will, as always, support Hong Kong's economic development and improvement of people's lives\". He also said Beijing was \"willing to work with all sectors of Hong Kong's society in maintaining Hong Kong's extraordinary journey these past 20 years\", and would \"ensure 'one country, two systems' will continue with stability\". The city was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing agreed to govern it under \"one country, two systems\", granting the city its own legal system, limited democracy with multiple political parties, and rights like freedom of assembly and free speech. But China's growing influence has been met with unease and concerns that the mainland could undermine Hong Kong's more politically liberal traditions. Activists have been campaigning for years for Hong Kong to have more political freedom. A series of official celebrations are planned for this weekend, as well as the inauguration of Hong Kong's incoming chief executive Carrie Lam.

Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London said it could help doctors investigating men with the condition. A UK expert said he hoped that further gene defects could be found. In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving. Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found. The latest research looks at a gene already known to be involved in sexual development in both men and women - defects in NR5A1 have been linked to physical defects in the development of the testicles or ovaries. Their findings suggest that, even where there is no physical evidence of a problem, defects in the gene may be hampering the ability to make sperm. They looked at the gene in 315 apparently healthy men who had an unexplained inability to produce sperm. From this group, they found mutations in the gene in just seven, and closer examination revealed the men had altered levels of sex hormones and, in one case, mild abnormalities in the cellular structure of the testicles. The research authors, from the UCL Institute of Child Health in London and the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said: \"We conclude that approximately 4% of men with otherwise unexplained failure to produce sperm carry mutations in the NR5A1 gene.\" Although the find would affect only a small proportion of infertile men, other specialists believe that other similar discoveries could help build up a clearer picture of the origins of the condition. Dr Allan Pacey, a senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said that there was still \"embarrassingly little\" known about the genetics behind male infertility. \"Given the complexity of the sperm production process it is likely that many genes are involved and therefore that may gene defects linked to infertility may be found. \"Although this gene defect affects only a small number of men, we need more studies like this so that we can fill in the gaps in our knowledge and possibly one day build a robust diagnostic test for male fertility based on genetics.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Who discovered a gene defect linked to male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 520}, {"question": "What is a cause of male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 521}, {"question": "Who discovered the gene defect that causes male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 522}, {"question": "What is a gene defect linked to ?", "answers": [], "id": 523}, {"question": "Who discovered the gene defect that is linked to male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 524}, {"question": "What is linked to male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 525}, {"question": "What is a gene defect related to ?", "answers": [], "id": 526}, {"question": "What can a gene defect be linked to ?", "answers": [], "id": 527}, {"question": "What was discovered to be connected to male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 528}, {"question": "What was discovered to be linked to male infertility ?", "answers": [], "id": 529}]}], "title": "Mutations of the NR5A1 gene"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Ronan Toolis led the excavation works at Trusty's Hill Fort at Gatehouse of Fleet.

The rules prevent non-EU chefs being employed if a restaurant offers a take-away service. The UK government said this was designed to drive innovative cuisine. But industry sources say it has led to restaurants closing because they cannot recruit skilled chefs. The rules, laid down by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Home Office, are part of the Tier 2 visa scheme, which allows workers of sufficient skill levels to be employed on the Shortage Occupation List. They must be paid at least \u00c2\u00a329,570 a year, and to meet the criteria the job must also not be in a fast food or \"standard fare\" outlet, or an establishment which provides a take-away service. But Ajmal Mushtaq, who runs a restaurant in Hamilton providing up to 3,000 meals a week, said that was \"total insanity\". Holding two portions of a curry - one on a plate, the other in a take-away carton - he said: \"Here is a chicken tikka chasni, one of our top selling dishes. \"What the government are saying is: if I put that same dish into a container, I'm not allowed to bring expert chefs over from India. \"The quality is the exact same.\" Mr Mushtaq said the restriction meant that plans to expand his restaurant have been put on hold. He currently employs three Indian-born chefs who have been in Scotland long enough to qualify for permanent resident status, but wants to increase his staffing. \"As a result of bringing over three chefs a few years ago, I have been able to create 52 jobs in this business,\" he said. \"We are at the point of expanding our business. If I were to bring over another two chefs, I would be able to increase the number of employees up to 95 in this one establishment alone.\" The industry has been putting pressure on the government to review its rules, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote, which it sees as offering an opportunity to workers outwith the EU. International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who campaigned for a Leave vote said during the campaign, said it was a \"travesty\" that curry houses were subjected to a \"second class UK immigration system\" in comparison to EU chefs. With a growth in online apps such as Hungry House and Just Eat promoting home delivery of food, Hans Ram, chief executive of the catering recruitment agency Goldstar Chefs, said the government approach to the Indian restaurant sector was wrong. \"They have totally misunderstood and misconceived the industry as being a low-paid, low-skilled jobs base. Which it is not,\" he said. \"The biggest consequence to this is actually the skills erosion - erosion of authenticity. \"It is affecting the product that the public are being served.\" He also pointed out that the Indian restaurant sector in the UK is worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a34bn a year.", "qas": [{"question": "What happened to the number of non-EU chefs allowed to work in Scottish curry houses ?", "answers": [], "id": 550}, {"question": "What has the restricting of non-EU chefs from working in curry houses been described as ?", "answers": [], "id": 551}, {"question": "What has the restriction on non-EU chefs in Scotland been described as ?", "answers": [], "id": 552}, {"question": "What has the restricting of non-EU chefs from working in Scottish curry houses been described as ?", "answers": [], "id": 553}, {"question": "Where are non-EU chefs banned from ?", "answers": [], "id": 554}, {"question": "What has the restriction of non-EU chefs working in Scottish curry houses been described as ?", "answers": [], "id": 555}, {"question": "What was the treatment of non-EU chefs in Scotland ?", "answers": [], "id": 556}, {"question": "What country has been restricting the number of non-EU chefs working in curry houses ?", "answers": [], "id": 557}, {"question": "What was restricted in Scottish curry houses ?", "answers": [], "id": 558}, {"question": "WhatHas the restriction of non-EU chefs working in Scottish curry houses come up as an example ?", "answers": [], "id": 559}]}], "title": "The warning comes as the"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "It's been almost a year since the 26-year-old released her last single.

Reports suggesting that the mainly black African Malian army, drawn largely from the south, has targeted Arabs and ethnic Tuaregs from the north expose a racial aspect to the war here which has been hidden by the emphasis on western troops fighting a war against Islamist insurgents, the BBC's Mark Doyle in Mali says. France intervened militarily on 11 January to halt a militant advance. It said al-Qaeda linked Islamists - some of whom were foreigners - threatened to turn Mali into a \"terrorist state\". It has bombed suspected rebel positions and deployed about 2,000 troops to help the weak Malian army recapture territory. FIDH said there needed to be an independent investigation into alleged abuses committed by Malian soldiers and those responsible should be punished. In the garrison town of Sevare, at least seven people were executed at a military camp, near a bus station and a hospital, it said. There was \"credible information\" pointing to 20 other executions in Sevare, with bodies \"buried hastily, notably in wells\", FIDH said. Summary killings also took place in the towns of Mopti and Niono, the group added. \"Other allegations of summary executions continue to come from all areas of the west and centre of the country,\" it said. It added that some of the victims were accused of possessing weapons, and of being \"infiltrators\" and \"accomplices\" of the militants. Others were killed because they did not have identity documents or simply because of their ethnicity, FIDH said. Dozens of ethnic Tuaregs in Mali's capital, Bamako, have also had their homes raided by troops, the group added. Voices from Diabaly after rebel battle.

People at the protest chanted: \"The people want to reform the regime.\" On Thursday evening, the king dissolved parliament and called early elections, though he did not specify a date. He has said he wants polls to be held by the end of the year. The IAF said it expected 50,000 people to take part in the protest outside the capital's al-Husseini mosque after Friday prayers. But the BBC's Wyre Davies put the turnout at 10,000 people, which he said was the biggest protest seen in Jordan for several years. Video footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The AFP news agency quoted people as shouting: \"We demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\" A counter-rally, in support of King Abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters, was cancelled late on Thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups. Earlier, police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns. Friday's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in July by the government of the conservative Prime Minister Fayez al-Tarawneh. The electoral law increased the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote. The IAF's leader, Hamza Mansour, dismissed the legislation as \"just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\". Opposition parties demanded that 50% of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats, or 18%. They also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from Bedouin districts. This, they argued, would continue to marginalise Jordanians of Palestinian origin - who make up 60% of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from Jordan's original Bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the Hashemite monarchy. Traditionally, many of the IAF's supporters have been Jordanians of Palestinian origin. The opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. Despite the call for reforms, Jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the Arab world last year. Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.

The ultimate aim of the research project is to develop robots that adapt to their surroundings. The work by teams in Cambridge and Zurich has been published in the journal PLOS One. It seems like a plot from a science fiction film: a robot that builds other robots - each one better than the previous generation. But that is what researchers in Cambridge and Zurich have done. But those concerned about machines taking over the world shouldn't worry, at least not yet. At this stage the \"baby robots\" consist of plastic cubes with a motor inside. These are put together by a \"mother\" robot arm which glues them together in different configurations. Although the set up is simple the system itself is ingenious. The mother robot assesses how far its babies are able to move, and with no human intervention, improves the design so that the next one it builds can move further. The mother robot built ten generations of children. The final version moved twice the distance of the first before its power ran out. According to Dr Fumiya Iida of Cambridge University, who led the research with colleagues at ETH Zurich, one aim is to gain new insights into how living things evolve. \"One of the big questions in biology is how intelligence came about - we're using robotics to explore this mystery,\" he told BBC News. \"We think of robots as performing repetitive tasks, and they're typically designed for mass production instead of mass customisation, but we want to see robots that are capable of innovation and creativity.\" Another aim is to develop robots that can improve and adapt to new situations, according to Andre Rosendo - who also worked on the project. \"You can imagine cars being built in factories and the robot looking for defects in the car and fixing them by itself,\" he said. \"And robots used in agriculture could try out slightly different ways of harvesting crops to see if they can improve yield.\" Dr Iidya told me that he came into robotics because he was disappointed that the robots he saw in real life were not as good as the ones he saw in science fiction films such as Star Wars and Star Trek. His aim was to change that and his approach was to draw lessons from the natural world to improve the efficiency and flexibility of traditional robotic systems.

Officials say the foreign aid-funded deal could save taxpayers \u00a310m a year when transfers begin in 2020.

Regional mayor Andy Burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced \"in due course\", the mayor's office said. The GMSF scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last October to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr Burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in May, promised to \"radically re-write\" the plans, calling them \"unfair and disproportionate\". The BBC understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew Collinge from the Save our Slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between Middleton and Royton, said the delay was \"disappointing\". He said: \"It stretches out the fear of the unknown and us.

Last year, scientists pinpointed a human gene that they think was behind the expansion of a key brain region known as the neocortex.

During this extended period of time, their brain size started to increase. They began to spread around the world, encountering different environments.

But she has requested treatment, including hormone therapy, and the ability to live as a woman. According to a complaint filed by Pte Manning's lawyer, a military doctor at Fort Leavenworth - where she is being held - had approved a treatment plan by November 2013. But it was delayed as it was sent higher up the chain of command for consideration.

Despite this policy, a recent study by a US university estimated there were about 15,000 transgender people serving in the US armed forces.

Pembrokeshire council has seen the price it gets for steel drop by 88% over the year - while Flintshire has seen the price for plastics halved. Experts say a slump in oil prices, cheap steel imports, and China's economic slowdown are to blame. \"We try to play the markets as best we can,\" Harvey Mitchell, the waste services manager for Flintshire, said. \"It makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we can't control, such as the global price of oil, or when larger countries flood the European market with steel.\" Flintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58% of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in Buckley. \"But while we've seen an increase in the amount of material we've collected, we've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices,\" Mr Mitchell said. Recycled waste netted the council \u00a3537,000 in revenue in 2015/16, but this represented a drop of 45% in the expected income - more than \u00a3400,000 in lost cash. The pattern has been repeated in Pembrokeshire, where \u00a3360,000 has been wiped off the council's expected income, while four other councils saw a combined drop of \u00a3335,000. \"This is an issue which is impacting upon Wales as a whole, not just Pembrokeshire,\" a council official there said. \"Fortunately quotes for the coming months are starting to look more positive with prices starting to increase.\" The impact on most of the other Welsh councils which responded to BBC Wales has been minimal, as they said are tied into long term contracts dealing with their recycling services. But one academic expert said authorities and the public in Wales will need to refocus as they face ever increasing targets on recycling.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Labour Party conference, Mr Jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only Westminster and Scotland. Now the Welsh secretary has pledged to keep Wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across Britain.

They highlighted particular concern about Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, where inspectors observed that \"the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. \"As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. \"A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women.\" In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can \"sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this\". The private boys' schools says it has an \"open door policy\" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the West Midlands police.

The Home Office said it was providing funding to bolster security and that many crossing attempts had been foiled. The FoI shows 46 illegal immigrants were detained or arrested at Dover - one of the main gateways to Britain - between January and April this year. The number of detentions and arrests is also up significantly from 2012, when 105 were held or arrested. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan are camped at a site dubbed \"the Jungle II\" near the Port of Calais. French aid workers have reported a \"catastrophic\" situation there. Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett, who recently visited Calais, said migrants are going to great lengths to cross the Channel. He told Radio Kent: \"They think it's a great place to be and (Britain's) their target. They will do anything they possibly can to get into the UK.\" Last week, Channel Tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the French side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board UK-bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the Calais area was the \"highest ever\". Hauliers have been advised by the Freight Transport Association not to stop within about 60 miles (97km) of Calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles.

He added: \"We are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern France and Belgium, including a \u00c2\u00a32m upgrade of detection technology, a \u00c2\u00a31m extension of dog searching capacity and \u00c2\u00a312m to reinforce security at Calais and other ports. \"During the current period of disruption to cross-Channel services, Border Force has put its contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained. \"We have deployed additional Border Force staff and sniffer dogs in northern France as well as bolstering screening checks at Dover for both tourist and freight vehicles.\" The Port of Dover Police is a non-Home Office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, Dover Harbour Board.

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The ORR employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. \"Despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,\" said John Larkinson, ORR director of railway markets and economics. \"We are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" he added. Rail operators C2C and Scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were \"baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in May, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"To quickly benefit passengers, the Rail Delivery Group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said Mr Larkinson. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, told the BBC that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as \"queue-busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but \"expectations [of passengers] had evolved\". He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The RDG also added: \"Complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. \"Simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,\" they added. by Ben Morris, business reporter. In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.", "qas": [{"question": "How many rail passengers are paying more than they need to ?", "answers": [], "id": 1190}, {"question": "What do a quarter of rail passengers pay more for than they need to ?", "answers": [], "id": 1191}, {"question": "What do a quarter of rail passengers pay more for than they need to for ?", "answers": [], "id": 1192}, {"question": "Who is paying more than they need to for their journey ?", "answers": [], "id": 1193}, {"question": "What do a third of rail passengers pay more for than they need to ?", "answers": [], "id": 1194}, {"question": "What do a quarter of rail passengers need to pay for ?", "answers": [], "id": 1195}, {"question": "Who is paying more for their journey than they need to ?", "answers": [], "id": 1196}, {"question": "What do a quarter of rail passengers pay for ?", "answers": [], "id": 1197}, {"question": "What is the source of the information about passengers ' costs ?", "answers": [], "id": 1198}, {"question": "How many rail passengers are charging more than they need to ?", "answers": [], "id": 1199}]}], "title": "While 7% of people underpay"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The company has been negotiating with the pension regulator and the PPF in a bid to offload its pension liabilities and a decision is expected soon.

Mr Comey is known for successfully opposing a warrantless wiretapping programme backed by other Bush aides. Mr Mueller took up his post shortly before the 9/11 attacks and is retiring as director on 4 September. In remarks on Friday, Mr Obama said the outgoing director had displayed \"a steady hand and strong leadership\" during his time at the head of the FBI. The US president said Mr Comey had \"law enforcement in his blood\". \"As a young prosecutor in the US attorney's office in Manhattan he helped bring down the Gambino crime family; as a federal prosecutor in Virginia he led an aggressive effort to combat gun violence that reduced homicide rates and saved lives,\" Mr Obama said. He also joked that Mr Comey - who is 6ft, 8in tall (2.03m) - was \"a man who stands up very tall for justice and the rule of law\". The nominee said he could not describe his excitement to work again with the FBI. \"They are men and women who have devoted their lives to serving and protecting others and I simply can't wait to be their colleague,\" he said. One of the most dramatic episodes of Mr Comey's tenure as deputy attorney general in the Bush administration came in 2004, when then-Attorney General John Ashcroft was ill in hospital. Mr Bush's White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andrew Card pressed him in his hospital bed to re-authorise a controversial programme allowing federal agents to eavesdrop on phone conversations without a warrant. Mr Comey, who was acting as attorney general in Mr Ashcroft's stead, rushed to the hospital and intervened. Changes were subsequently made to the programme and Mr Comey drew wide praise. Mr Obama alluded to the incident on Friday, saying Mr Comey \"was prepared to give up a job he loved rather than be part of something he felt was fundamentally wrong\". After leaving the Bush administration, Mr Comey was general counsel for Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund in the US state of Connecticut. He now lectures at Columbia University law school in New York.

But she has already ruled out the widespread sale of Welsh woodlands. Forestry Commission Wales said it would explore the feasibility of transfer to the private sector case by case. The minister told BBC Radio Wales she plans to \"compensate\" the public by buying new land for new planting or management if any forest was sold off on a case-by-case basis. \"I don't want any stagnancy in the forest estate. I want it to work for public benefit whether that's economic or environmental or access benefit,\" she said. \"It's my view there should be no reduction in the publicly owned estate and I have asked the Forestry Commission to look at how it can make that estate work harder, provide a better return for the public. \"Whether that's in terms of public access, in terms of environmental benefit in the production of renewable energy or biomass potential or also in terms of the economic return from that forestry estate.\" The minister is due to outline her plans to AMs during Tuesday's plenary session in the Senedd. Further commercialisation being planned would include partnerships with the private sector for more forest holidays, wind farms and limited extraction of coalfield methane. Around 37% of Welsh woodland comes under the Assembly Government Woodland Estate (AGWE). A report commissioned by the assembly examined a number of options, including a complete sell-off of the land to the private sector or a not-for-profit trust. It warned there were potential difficulties with both of these, instead recommending that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the future of Wales' forests. Jerry Langford, the Woodland Trust's director in Wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were \"considered and enlightened\". \"If these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new 'age of the tree' in Wales,\" he said. Any sell-off in Wales would release resources to the FC to purchase other areas of land not currently under its management to increase their public benefit. Overall, there would be no reduction in the size of the Welsh forests in public ownership. The report states: \"The minister agreed that FC Wales should adopt whenever possible a more commercial approach to its management of the estate and in particular to be pro-active and imaginative in exploring opportunities for deeper commercialisation when dealing with the private sector.\" Forestry Commission Wales said it would \"explore the feasibility of small-scale transfer to the third sector on a case by case basis\".

Tensions also rose after Pakistan sentenced an Indian national, Kulbhushan Jadhav, to death on charges of spying. On her arrival in Delhi, Uzma described Pakistan as \"a death trap\". \"I've seen women who go there after arranged marriages. They're miserable and living in terrible circumstances. There're two, three, even four wives in every house,\" she told a press conference. \"If I'd remained there for a few days more, I would have died.\" Uzma met Tahir Ali in Malaysia and fell in love with him, according to reports. She then travelled to Pakistan earlier this month where, she said, she was forced into marriage on 3 May. While there is enough evidence to suggest that Uzma came to Pakistan of her own accord, it remains unclear why she changed her mind. Tahir Ali has said that his father sponsored Uzma's visa for Pakistan after the couple met in Malaysia and decided to get married. Uzma's contention that she was married at \"gunpoint\" sits uneasily against the fact that she, along with Mr Ali and his relatives, had visited a district court in Buner town to get married. The official who performed the wedding says she appeared to participate willingly in the ceremony. Mr Ali has alleged that Indian officials at the high commission forced her to change her mind. On 12 May, Uzma filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court, accusing her husband of harassing and intimidating her, and taking away her travel documents to stop her from leaving Pakistan. She told the court that he had not told her that he was a married father of four and that she had been \"terribly beaten... tortured physically and mentally\". Uzma also has a five-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage. Her lawyer requested that the court should allow her to go back to India, saying her daughter was thalassaemic and needed daily blood transfusions. Mr Ali told BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad that the charges against him were false - he said she had known about his marital status and was \"disappointed\" that he was not allowed to speak to her under court's supervision. He said he was \"confident\" that she would get in touch with him once the dust had settled.", "qas": [{"question": "What was the Indian woman saying she was forced into ?", "answers": [], "id": 1390}, {"question": "What is the nationality of the woman rescued ?", "answers": [], "id": 1391}, {"question": "What nationality is the woman who was forced into marriage ?", "answers": [], "id": 1392}, {"question": "Who has returned home after being forced into marriage ?", "answers": [], "id": 1393}, {"question": "Did the woman marry the man she was forced into marriage ?", "answers": [], "id": 1394}, {"question": "Who was the Indian woman married to ?", "answers": [], "id": 1395}, {"question": "What did An Indian woman say she was forced into ?", "answers": [], "id": 1396}, {"question": "What does the woman say she was forced into marriage by her husband ?", "answers": [], "id": 1397}, {"question": "What nationality is the woman who returned home ?", "answers": [], "id": 1398}, {"question": "What did the Indian woman say she was forced into marriage by ?", "answers": [], "id": 1399}]}], "title": "The woman, named only as"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Carwyn Jones said Wales had a \"proud tradition of being a friendly and hospitable nation\". \"The message of peace and hope is particularly poignant this year,\" he said, referring to the terrorist attacks in Tunisia and Paris.

Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways. Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography. The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being \"loving and normal young man\". Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his \"own strange pleasure\", they were serious matters as \"children were abused for these images to be made\". He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that \"society would not tolerate such behaviour\". Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating. During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images \"for perhaps the last nine years\".

A Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber.

The statement said the Karabulak Gendarmerie Station was hit at around 03:00 local time on Sunday (midnight GMT). Images in the Turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured.

The appointment breaks an HSBC tradition of appointing insiders to the chairmanship. One of his first jobs will be to find a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, who plans to step down next year. While HSBC is Europe's biggest bank, the bulk of its profits are generated in Asia. Mr Tucker has been chief executive of AIA for seven years, during which he oversaw the insurer's expansion in Asia. Before AIA, he was the chief executive of insurance giant Prudential, and brings to HSBC his experience at the top of a UK financial giant as well as his Asian exposure. Richard Dunbar of Aberdeen Asset Management, told the BBC the bank has \"obviously decided\" that an external perspective would be useful to HSBC at this time. He added that while chief executive of Prudential, Mr Tucker did a good job of expanding its Asian assets, which are seen as the firm's \"jewel in the crown\". HSBC has been through an overhaul in recent years in an attempt to reverse declining profits. Over the past six years it has cut more than 40,000 jobs and sold off businesses. Despite those efforts, profits tumbled more than 60% last year. The banking industry has been hampered by the extended period of very low interest rates, which makes lending money less profitable. For HSBC, that problem has been compounded by its move into less risky areas of banking since the financial crisis which started in 2007. Those challenges make the appointment of a new chief executive even more crucial for investors, a search which will now be led by Mr Tucker.

The Conservative politician was in Scotland a day after the Scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his Scottish government counterpart Michael Russell for talks. When asked if the First Minister is being \"realistic\" with her demands, he said: \"They are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\" Before the EU referendum in June, leading Brexit campaigner and then justice secretary Michael Gove had suggested Scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the EU. But Mr Davis said: \"It's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work.\" He insisted the Brexit arrangements would be a \"United Kingdom deal\", rejecting the idea put forward by the Scottish Government that the country should be able to keep its place in the European single market. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to \"protect Scotland's interests\" in the wake of the Brexit vote. But she has insisted her government was \"exploring all of the options\" for safeguarding Scotland's place in Europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK leaves. After his first meeting with Mr Davis, Mr Russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for Scottish input into the Brexit process. Speaking at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Mr Davis said while it has \"got to be a United Kingdom deal\", it would \"incorporate protection for the people of Scotland\". He also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of Scotland\". Mr Davis stated: \"The aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the European Union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. \"How we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\" He continued: \"I don't think the Scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. \"I have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the Scottish people.\" Yesterday the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said that he thinks the United Kingdom might actually rein back on Brexit. Mr Davis told BBC Scotland that is not the case: \"That's not going to happen.

Its illustrious fans have included the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and actors such as Cary Grant. But after the British firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on China and last year saw its UK sales fall 16%. Hong Kong-based YGM Trading, which bought it for \u00a315m four years ago, said Aquascutum is due to be sold in March 2017 to two buyers. The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by British soldiers during the First World War, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer Edmund Hillary in the first confirmed ascent of Mount Everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with Sean Connery wearing one in Another Time, Another Place in 1958 and Sophia Loren in The Key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its Nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration.

The sum is the equivalent of BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies, which would have to be taken off air, Mr Purnell said at an event to relaunch the iPlayer service. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the BBC's charter before 2017. Mr Purnell, who previously held the post in the Labour government, said \"it would be a huge risk to do it now\". \"The choice would be: either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,\" he said in reference to BBC Four - the arts and culture channel - and the BBC's children's stations. He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the TV licence, which would force an increase in the fee. It is currently \u00a3145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device. In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180,000 prosecutions. Mr Purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor. \"Either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,\" he said. The BBC has previously said \"legislation is a matter for the government\". \"Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around \u00a335m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations,\" it added. The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system. But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the BBC is funded what it does and how it is managed. The current BBC charter runs out in 2016. Meanwhile, Labour MP John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling on the BBC to reverse its decision to close BBC Three as a television channel.

Ministers fear there could be major disruption for travellers, so volunteers are being asked to step in.

It is expected they would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the European Economic Area and man so-called \"e-gates\" where passengers use their biometric passports. A UKBA spokesman said: \"The security of the UK border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\" However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk. Mr Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of \"blind panic\" at the 11th hour, he said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading \"PR exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through \"damaging\" changes. \"Instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" he said. The government has confirmed earlier reports that UKBA is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike. In the wake of the recent row between Home Secretary Theresa May and former UK border force chief Brodie Clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues. The BBC has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes. The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions. It also promised improved accrual rates. Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill. Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector.

The three-month protest was sparked by a local dispute between Catholic and Protestant residents in Ardoyne, north Belfast. The Protestants claimed that Catholics were attacking their homes and said the school protest was their way of highlighting their concerns. However, stones, bottles, fireworks and even a blast bomb were used during weeks of unrest. Following the initial violence, the police and Army put up crash barriers to keep a corridor route open for the Holy Cross pupils. Armed police officers escorted the children to class until the dispute was resolved. Ardoyne's parish priest at the time, Fr Aidan Troy, told the Belfast Telegraph he could \"fully understand why people who have been through trauma would want to apply for compensation\". \"These were girls aged between four and 11, they were very young and very impressionable and were deeply affected by it. Every one of us were,\" he said. The priest added that while he would not \"go down the route of compensation myself\" he could \"well imagine the impact would be very great on children at such a formative age\". \"You could see their trauma,\" said Fr Troy. About 100 pupils needed counselling due to their daily ordeal, according to principal at the time, Anne Tanney. Speaking to the BBC in 2004, she said that even as an adult, she was traumatised by the protests . \"There were times when I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep,\" she said. \"I used to bite my lip, trying not to cry in front of the children.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Who were injured during a loyalist protest ?", "answers": [], "id": 1710}, {"question": "Where were injured during a loyalist protest ?", "answers": [], "id": 1711}, {"question": "What have former pupils who were injured during a loyalist protest been paid ?", "answers": [], "id": 1712}, {"question": "What have former pupils who were injured during a loyalist protest been given ?", "answers": [], "id": 1713}, {"question": "What were the people injured during the protest in north Belfast given ?", "answers": [], "id": 1714}, {"question": "Who was injured at a loyalist protest in north Belfast ?", "answers": [], "id": 1715}, {"question": "What were the people injured in north Belfast given by the school ?", "answers": [], "id": 1716}, {"question": "Who was injured at a loyalist protest ?", "answers": [], "id": 1717}, {"question": "Who was injured during the protest in north Belfast ?", "answers": [], "id": 1718}, {"question": "What did former pupils receive in Belfast ?", "answers": [], "id": 1719}]}], "title": "The ex-pupils were caught up"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The rural grave, discovered last November in the town of Tetelcingo, consists of two 10m (33ft) deep pits.

A leader of the rival 18 Street gang - who did not want to be identified - offered the same promises, but only \"if the government will listen,\" he added. On Monday, the Honduran President Porfirio Lobo personally offered his support for the truce. \"We have to look for anything that's an alternative to violence,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. \"On the part of the government, we are open to any process that can lower violence.\" The Roman Catholic Bishop Romulo Emiliani, who helped to broker the deal, said last week that the gangs needed government help to break away from their criminal activities, which included extorting money from businesses to finance their war. He said the authorities should try to turn Honduras' prisons into rehabilitation centres. His comments were echoed by gang leader Marco, who called on the government to support craft workshops so that they could work, earn a living and be reintegrated into society. \"I want my son to be a doctor or a cameraman, not a gangster,\" he said. The BBC Central America Correspondent Will Grant says this is a significant step towards a full peace accord. He adds that, in Honduras, hopes remain high that this latest plan could help tackle gang crime in the country. The deal follows a similar pact reached more than a year ago in neighbouring El Salvador. The peace agreement there has roughly held together and, the authorities say, has contributed to a significant reduction in the murder rate and incidences of other violent crimes. The Salvadorian government says homicides have dropped about 52%. Mara Salvatrucha and Mara 18 Street have their roots in the 1980s in southern California.

For features such as the planet's Great Red Spot - a huge storm that has raged for at least 400 years - the scientists can see something of its roots. The observations go many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere. \"What really excites me is just the level of detail we see,\" said team-member Michael Wong from the University of California, Berkeley. \"In our maps you can see different zones, turbulent features, vortices - even the Great Red Spot. \"This has all been made possible by an upgrade to the VLA and a new technique developed by one of our co-workers,\" he told BBC News. The Karl G Jansky Very Large Array is based in the desert of New Mexico, close to the town of Socorro. As its name suggests, it is multi-antenna telescope. The upgrade Dr Wong is referring to has made the facility a far more sensitive tool for studying the radio emissions coming from objects in space. And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body (Jupiter's \"day\" lasts just 10 hours). The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet's atmosphere. The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet's gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At Earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer. \"We see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained Dr Wong. \"The deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 Bar - 12 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure.\" Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal Science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s. \"All told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere in these new VLA images,\" said Imke de Pater, the lead author on the Science paper. \"We hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de Pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants Saturn and Uranus. The research is a nice prelude to the next probe set to visit Jupiter: the US space agency satellite Juno arrives at the enormous planet on 4 July. Its remote sensing instruments aim to characterise the full internal structure of the planet, right down to its rocky core - if indeed it has one.

The company behind the development, Tekever, said the technology could in the short term be used to enable people with restricted movement to control aircraft. Longer term the firm said piloting of larger jets, such as cargo planes, could be controlled in this way without the need for a crew on board. However, one aviation expert told the BBC he thought the industry would be unlikely to adopt such technology due to a perception of being potentially unsafe. Drone specialist Tekever, which works with security firms, police forces and the military, adapted existing Electroencephalography (EEG) technology so it could issue instructions to the software used to give the unmanned drone instructions. EEG works by detecting activity in specific parts of the brain. After several months of training, \"pilots\" are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down, which in turn steers the drone left or right. \"We believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,\" said Ricardo Mendes, Tekever's chief operating officer. \"We truly believe that Brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions, and we're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products.\" In the future, some of this technology may be put to use to control much larger aircraft, although Mr Mendes acknowledged considerable challenges with both regulatory hurdles and public confidence. Those concerns were echoed by John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant based in London. \"This to me is certainly at the moment a bridge too far,\" he told the BBC. \"You could get someone radically-minded who might say it, but I'd be surprised if anyone would do it.\" Mr Strickland said the airline industry was instead focusing its innovation efforts towards things like better materials and more economical engines. Mr Mendes said the technology would incorporate safety measures to counteract the effects of someone having, for example, a seizure while piloting. \"There are algorithms on board that prevent bad things from happening,\" he told the BBC.

The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public.

Nick Beake: An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice- or Berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick Beake: The current terrorist threat is rated as \"severe\", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: \"Run, hide, tell.\" More information can be found on the gov.uk website. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick Beake: If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related? Nick Beake: It can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be.

The dead included children, a dentist and the only paediatrician left in rebel-held areas of the city, civil defence volunteers told AFP news agency. The upsurge in fighting in Syria's largest city comes amid reports that government forces, backed by Russian air power, are gearing up for a major offensive there. Russia's continuing war. Has opportunity for peace been lost? What is left of Syria? Assad's growing confidence. The escalation has threatened to derail the UN-brokered peace talks, which resumed last month. The Western-backed opposition delegation, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), last week suspended its role to protest against alleged ceasefire violations by the government and a fall in humanitarian aid deliveries to besieged areas. Speaking on Wednesday after a third round of talks in Geneva, Mr de Mistura said the fragile \"cessation of hostilities\" \"could collapse any time\". He said that over the past 48 hours an average of one Syrian had been killed every 25 minutes and one wounded every 13 minutes. For the peace talks to succeed, Mr de Mistura said, hostilities would need to be reduced to the levels seen immediately following the February agreement. Calling on the US and Russia to co-operate, Mr de Mistura said that the legacies of both President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin were linked to the success of the peace process in Syria. There will be one or two more rounds of talks before July, Mr de Mistura said. He added: \"There are still major differences on the major issues, but there is movement on certain areas where there was not before.\" Mr de Mistura also said that equal rights and equal representation in major institutions for women was essential to the transition to a new Syria. The peace talks do not involve the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front and the so-called Islamic State, which have been fighting government forces and other rebels across Syria.

The rise followed US data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in Canada. Brent crude has now risen 80% since it hit 13-year lows of below $28 a barrel at the start of the year. US crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in Canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in Nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as China, India and Russia. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"We do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in US output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing.\" Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit $50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $60 by the end of 2017. The US bank said: \"The oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in Nigeria, higher output in Iran and better demand. \"With each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.\" In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. BP said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017. And last month US oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $50. Adam Laird, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC: \"This is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of $50] could be enough to make some executives reassess.\" However, Mr Laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. \"It's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound,\" he said. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil markets analyst at Natixis, agreed and said: \"We believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What has risen above $ 50 a barrel for the first time this year ?", "answers": [], "id": 1920}, {"question": "For how long has oil prices risen above $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1921}, {"question": "For how long has oil cost more than $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1922}, {"question": "For how long has oil price risen above $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1923}, {"question": "For how long has oil cost more than $ 50 per barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1924}, {"question": "For how long has oil been above $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1925}, {"question": "For how long has oil cost $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1926}, {"question": "For how long has oil prices been above $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1927}, {"question": "In what year did oil prices first rise above $ 50 a barrel ?", "answers": [], "id": 1928}, {"question": "The amount oil prices have risen above $ 50 a barrel is the first time this year ?", "answers": [], "id": 1929}]}], "title": "Benchmark Brent crude hit $50.22"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The price of Brent crude oil fell below $39 a barrel at one point, its lowest since December 2008.

The price of Brent crude fell to $38.90 a barrel at one point, before recovering slightly to $39.13 - still down 60 cents in the trading session. US crude oil also fell, down 50 cents to $36.12 a barrel. Oil prices are down more than 10% over the week.

That comes at a time when the world's economic growth is slowing, blunting demand for raw materials.

But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: \"All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. \"While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience.\" The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom French, of the Equality Network charity, said backing the Bill would help remove discrimination from law. \"With just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage Bill, we urge MSPs to stand up for a fairer and more equal Scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support,\" he said. \"The large majority of people in Scotland believe it's time LGBT people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This Bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are.\" But campaign group Scotland for Marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: \"The Scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. \"Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don't support this law. \"No one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected.\" In England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July.

Kilcoo's lead was cut to a point but the Down champions moved three ahead again and then held on. Scotstown duo Francis Caulfield and sub Brian McGinnity were sent off late on. Caulfield was dismissed after getting a second yellow card while McGinnity saw red after appearing to strike impressive Kilcoo full-back Darragh O'Hanlon. The Monaghan champions, beaten by Crossmaglen after extra-time in last year's provincial final, only had points from Darren Hughes and Donal Morgan to show for their early domination as several other good chances were missed. Kilcoo hit back with five unanswered points after Aaron Branigan opened up their account in the ninth minute. Conor Laverty's typically busy display was crucial to Kilcoo's improvement as Donal Kane, Paul Devlin (two) and Martin Devlin also notched points. After being held scoreless for almost 20 minutes, Scotstown found their range again late in the first half as the lively Shane Carey pointed a free and keeper Rory Beggan also hit the target from a 45 after missing three earlier long-range efforts. Aidan Branigan's departure at half-time looked a blow for Kilcoo but instead his replacement Johnston went on to become the central personality in the match. The sides were level at 0-6 a piece when Johnston held his nerve to produce a great finish past Beggan after Laverty had flicked on a long ball. After Shane Carey's reply, Johnston looked to have palmed in a second Kilcoo goal but the effort was ruled out - harshly it appeared - for a square ball. The controversial decision looked as though it could be match-turning as another Carey point cut Kilcoo's lead to the minimum but crucially Beggan and Carey then missed chances to get Scotstown on terms. Paul Devlin's superb long-range point and an Aaron Morgan score, after more great work by Laverty, left Kilcoo three ahead with three minutes of normal time left and Carey's seventh point was all Scotstown could summon in the remaining eight minutes of action.

In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel \"that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre\".

Initially, fines were levied at \u00a360, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight.

Delegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics. It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said. The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE. But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease. Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test. Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients. But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising. \"Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test. \"As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.\" He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment.

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent. The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant \"both in terms of its size and its capability\". \"A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" he added. \"This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. \"There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" Det Supt Geddes said.

Its chief executive Matt Shardlow said that if the country keeps on having periods of damp weather, then it could prove dangerous for some rare species. \"They might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction,\" he said. This year saw the wettest April-June quarter on record and further heavy rain in July. Mr Shardlow said the damp conditions have resulted in fewer aphids for wasps to feed on, which has reduced their numbers. It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover, he added. He also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the UK need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen. \"We are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on.\" Buglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers, but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect \"massive year-on-year variation\" which they have reported this year. However, some data is collated on butterfly numbers, and Mr Shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the UK. Moths, too, are being seen in fewer numbers, he said. However, the wet weather has been good news for some insects, such as the crane fly, drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails, which all thrive in the damp conditions. \"This means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year,\" Mr Shardlow said. \"We've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails.\" But Richard Ridler, chairman of Essex Beekeepers' Association, says this year's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees, just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens. \"The problem was that we had an appalling start to the year, which meant the bees stayed at home. Instead of going out, they stayed in their hives and ate their honey. I've had 25% of the honey yield that I would have expected this year. \"So the public saw a lot less of them. I haven't had beekeepers telling me that they've lost more bees than usual. \"This has been the most unusual, bizarre beekeeping year because of the weather.

But a European Commission spokeswoman later said those representatives would arrive \"in the coming days\". Separately, Greece formally submitted a request for a new loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a letter to IMF head Christine Lagarde dated 23 July but released to the public on Friday, Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos wrote that Athens was \"seeking a new loan\". Greece had initially planned not to ask the IMF for more funds, reports say. Greek MPs have approved tough new conditions set by the EU lenders for talks on the bailout. It is unclear when IMF officials will be joining the negotiations. The Washington-based IMF wants Greece's debt burden to be reduced to a level it considers \"sustainable\", but it faces resistance from reluctant European partners. EU officials said on Friday that there were \"logistical issues to solve\" before high-level talks with Athens could begin, but that negotiations were taking place at a technical level. The Greek team had been expected to meet top representatives from the European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - the eurozone's main bailout fund. Talks on the bailout package are expected to last a month. Tight capital controls, introduced at the end of June, remain in place to prevent a run on Greece's cash-strapped banks. PM Tsipras faced a backlash from MPs in his own left-wing Syriza party, during two parliamentary votes on austerity measures required by the creditors in order for negotiations to start. But he secured parliament's backing after a second crucial vote passed early on Thursday. The reforms debated this week included changes to Greek banking and an overhaul of the judiciary. Last week, Greece passed an initial set of austerity measures, including tax rises and pushing back the retirement age. Mr Tsipras has said that he is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that his government was forced to choose a \"difficult compromise\" to avoid Greece exiting the eurozone. A decision on more contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - has been pushed back to August. Demonstrations have taken place on the streets of Athens against the bailout deal and trade unions have taken strike action. On Wednesday, the ECB increased its cash lifeline to Greek banks by \u20ac900m - the second rise in a week. The IMF confirmed on Monday that Greece had cleared its overdue debt repayments of \u20ac2.05bn and was no longer in arrears. The repayments, which included \u20ac4.2bn to the ECB, were made possible by a short-term EU loan of \u20ac7.16bn.

Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was \"the future\" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. \"After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells.\" He added: \"Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life.\" But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. \"Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs.\" Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: \"This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. \"It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. \"Cells can do so much.

Streep was talking to the BBC ahead of the London premiere of her film, Suffragette, about the militant campaign in support of women's voting rights in the UK. Suffragette opened the London Film Festival which is also held a global symposium on gender in the media with Oscar-winning actress Geena Davis. At the symposium Davis called for more women on screen and more challenging female roles in TV and film. \"We are unwittingly training generation after generation to see men and women as unequal,\" said Davis who was speaking on gender in media in London. \"Surely in the 21st century we should be showing kids that boys and girls should be sharing the sandbox equally?\" Earlier this year Davis launched a Hollywood film festival to both highlight the problem and showcase the work of female talent in the industry.

The vote came a day after the Senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law with a Republican plan. Senators will now consider a \"skinny\" repeal, which would scale back some of the more controversial provisions. The \"skinny\" plan would eliminate unpopular parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage as well as a tax on medical devices. If that measure passes, the Senate and House of Representatives would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still change during negotiations. If successful, the full House and Senate would again have to approve the measure. Seven Republicans opposed the repeal-only plan on Wednesday, which included a two-year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. The defeat is the latest blow for President Donald Trump, who put repealing Obamacare at the centre of his election campaign, and underscores sharp divisions within the Republican Party over a replacement plan. A proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare with the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), a Republican plan that was crafted over last two months, collapsed on Tuesday night after nine Republicans voted against it. Republicans have long railed against Obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative included steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. And it removes Obamacare's individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. Other attempts to replace Obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to Republican divisions. In an early morning tweet on Wednesday, Mr Trump lambasted Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for opposing the party's plan, saying she \"really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!\" Mrs Murkowski was one of two Republicans earlier on Tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward. But her party eked out a victory after Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place. Senator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to Congress to cast his \"Yes\" vote. President Trump tweeted his thanks to the Arizona senator for playing \"such a vital role\" in the vote.", "qas": [{"question": "What did the US Senate fail to repeal ?", "answers": [], "id": 2560}, {"question": "What body has rejected a Republican plan to repeal Obamacare ?", "answers": [], "id": 2561}, {"question": "What kind of healthcare plan was rejected by the Senate ?", "answers": [], "id": 2562}, {"question": "What did the US Senate reject a repeal of ?", "answers": [], "id": 2563}, {"question": "What president has been rejected by the Senate for his healthcare plan ?", "answers": [], "id": 2564}, {"question": "What body has rejected a Republican plan to repeal the healthcare law ?", "answers": [], "id": 2565}, {"question": "What body has rejected a Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act ?", "answers": [], "id": 2566}, {"question": "What type of plan did the US Senate hear ?", "answers": [], "id": 2567}, {"question": "Which president had to approve a bill to repeal the healthcare law ?", "answers": [], "id": 2568}, {"question": "What kind of plan did the US Senate hear ?", "answers": [], "id": 2569}]}], "title": "The 45-55 vote marks the"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The 33-year-old made a total of 12 Test appearances and played a vital role in the 2010-11 Ashes victory in Australia. \"After 16 enjoyable years I feel that now is the right moment to call time on my playing career,\" the Surrey player wrote on Twitter. \"Unfortunately injury has hampered me throughout my career and now plays the leading role in my decision to retire.\" Tremlett has been affected by back and knee injuries in recent years and has been restricted to three Championship appearances for Surrey this season. \"My body, and back in particular, can no longer withstand the vigour of performing at the level required to play professional cricket,\" he said. \"After taking specialist advice this latest injury means that I will not be able to carry on. \"I have always tried to give 100% commitment and effort whenever I have played but no longer feel that this is possible.\" Southampton-born Tremlett, who began his career at Hampshire before moving to Surrey in 2010, took 53 wickets at an average of 27 in his 12 Test appearances for England.

He claimed it posed a risk of reputational damage to him and losses to his business. But the department said the stated risk was \"tenuous in the extreme\" and it was within its rights to proceed. The RHI scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses have been receiving more in subsidies than they are paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed. Boiler owners claim the subsidy is not simply profit, but also covers the cost of fuel and bank loans taken out to install the technology. The fallout from the scandal surrounding the scheme, which at one point had a projected overspend of \u00a3490m, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March. The applicant claimed the publication of recipients' details would not differentiate between those on a capped scheme and those who had benefitted from earlier, more generous tariffs. The business owner, named only as WB, invested \u00a3100,000 in a boiler and was accredited to the scheme in January 2016. That meant he was eligible only for payments limited by cost controls. The court was told his first annual payment had been \u00a35,200 - taking him just above the \u00a35,000 limit under which companies are not named. His barrister told the court his client could not \"avail of uncapped or untiered payments\", but the department was not drawing that distinction in the information it planned to publish. He added that there was no \"potential for abuse\" in the capped scheme, so the public interest in publication of his details did not apply to the same extent. But a barrister for the department said the date of application would be included in the information to be published. He said that would allow the discerning reader to differentiate which tariff applied to the applicant. And he said it would show the applicant had not sought to get into the scheme during a huge spike in applications in Autumn 2015. The barrister said it was important that information was published \"wholesale\" so that the public could see the scheme's cost controls were working. The department has already published a list of limited companies that receive RHI subsidies. But under data protection regulations, they had to give people who had applied under their own names the opportunity to explain why their details should not be made public. The deadline for receipt of that information expires on Wednesday. The court heard the department planned to publish the information next week. Since April 2017, all RHI recipients have been moved to the capped and tiered scheme.

Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. \"They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China,\" he said.

After consultations, MPs returned the bill to him last month, unaltered. The law would allow women to terminate a pregnancy in any circumstances up to 12 weeks and in cases of incest, rape and foetal impairment up to 24 weeks. Abortion is currently illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances. Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and five Sierra Leonean organisations, wrote to President Koroma in February urging him to give the bill his assent. \"Unsafe abortions - often resulting from restrictive laws and poor access to sexual and reproductive health services, information, and education - is one of the main factors contributing to maternal deaths in Sierra Leone,\" their letter said. The World Health Organization estimates that Sierra Leone has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio at 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births last year. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says the abortion issue has led to heated debates and protests on both sides. President Koroma has now referred the controversial legislation to the Constitutional Review Committee, which is currently reviewing the constitution. Our correspondent says it will decide whether to include the abortion law in its recommended changes to the constitution, which will be put to a referendum. When President Koroma sent the legislation back to parliament in January, he asked for it to be reviewed after consultation with religious and women's groups as it went beyond an African Union protocol on women's rights which only backs abortion in cases of sexual assault and in medical emergencies. Under Sierra Leone's current constitution, the president cannot veto a bill which received a two-thirds majority in parliament, our reporter says. The speaker of the house could sign the Safe Abortion Act into law, but our correspondent says he is highly unlikely to do so as he comes from the president's party. Mr Koroma met leaders from the Inter Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL), who all oppose abortion, in January, saying they \"represent a huge constituency across the country\". Catholic Archbishop Tamba Charles, vice-president of IRCSL, reiterated their view at summit on the issue later in the month declaring: \"No life can be destroyed on the basis of choice as life is sacred. \"If they want to fight for the right of women, then let them be provided with the required medical facilities that will help reduce maternal mortality rate in the country,\" Sierra Leone's Politico news website quotes him as saying.

About 36% of Android devices run Lollipop, with fewer than 3% running the newer Marshmallow. But a range of new smartphones running Marshmallow, from manufacturers such as Samsung and LG, are due to be released. Android N will introduce split-screen multitasking that allows people to use two apps at the same time. Information can be copied across from one app to the other. A similar feature is already available on some iOS and Windows 10 devices, and Samsung has already added the feature to some of its Android smartphones. The new software also introduces some cosmetic changes to settings and notifications, and aims to improve battery life.

The system utilises one of the University's Digitally Enhanced Learning Spaces (DELS), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools.

He said: \"The biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. \"We aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the GP's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action.\" Dr McKeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: \"This means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing GPs who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. \"The system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a GP. \"This allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day.\" Dr McKeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new GPs in Scotland.", "qas": [{"question": "What has been developed to allow trainee doctors to see their first live consultations ?", "answers": [], "id": 2940}, {"question": "What can be accessed by trainees through the new system ?", "answers": [], "id": 2941}, {"question": "What is used to allow trainees to see live consultations ?", "answers": [], "id": 2942}, {"question": "What is a new system developed to allow trainee doctors to see what ?", "answers": [], "id": 2943}, {"question": "Who is now able to see live consultations ?", "answers": [], "id": 2944}, {"question": "What is a new system being used for trainee doctors to see ?", "answers": [], "id": 2945}, {"question": "What is a new system that allows trainee doctors to see what ?", "answers": [], "id": 2946}, {"question": "What is used to allow trainee doctors to see live consultations ?", "answers": [], "id": 2947}, {"question": "Who can now see their first live consultations ?", "answers": [], "id": 2948}, {"question": "What is a new system being used to allow trainee doctors to see ?", "answers": [], "id": 2949}]}], "title": "Previously, trainee doctors had to"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Anastasia Deyeva, 24, has been appointed a deputy interior minister, unprecedented for anyone of her age.

She defended her credentials, telling one interviewer (in Russian) she had exactly the right experience for the job. She was an aide to an MP, worked for a Swedish energy company and was considered suitably qualified enough to be offered an interior ministry job in 2015. But her promotion to become Ukraine's youngest ever deputy minster unleashed a torrent of criticism. \"I knew that I'd end up in the limelight, that there would be criticism and biased commentary.

It is the third such attack since new PM Nawaz Sharif won elections in May. He has demanded an end to such attacks. A government statement said the strike violated Pakistan's sovereignty. \"Pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said. \"They are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications.\" In a separate development, at least six security personnel are reported to have been killed and at least six more injured in an early morning attack by militants at a checkpoint near Peshawar. At least two more are reported to be missing, possibly kidnapped by the attackers. Reports citing local officials said most of those killed in the drone strike were thought to be from the militant Haqqani group. Officials say four missiles were fired by a US drone, targeting two houses and two vehicles, near Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan. A number of other people were also injured. The Haqqani network has been described by US military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in Afghanistan. The troubled border region is a known stronghold for al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. Seven people were killed in a similar strike on 8 June, also in North Waziristan, just three days after the new prime minister was sworn in. After that incident the Pakistani government summoned a senior US diplomat in protest, condemning what it called a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". At least two key leaders of the Pakistani Taliban have been killed in earlier US drone strikes this year. Mullah Nazir was killed in January and Waliur Rehman was killed in May, shortly after Mr Sharif swept to election victory. The BBC's Richard Galpin in Islamabad says that the latest air strike by US forces will further heighten tensions between Washington and the new Pakistani government. Mr Sharif has called for a joint strategy to stop US drone strikes. The issue is hugely controversial in Pakistan, where parts of the government and military have often been accused of criticising the use of drones in public, but co-operating in private. Drone strikes are a source of severe tension between the US and Pakistan. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2013, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan killed up to 3,460 people. About 890 of them were civilians and the vast majority of strikes were carried out by the Obama administration, research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism said.

Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report said: \"Despite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements.\" Households aged between 45-54 saw the biggest increases in their pension wealth which rose on average by \u00c2\u00a338,000 over the period. Mr Innes added: \"Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.\" The report added that the range of experiences among the study group was vast - for example, a quarter of households aged 45-54 saw wealth fall by more than \u00c2\u00a369,000, while a quarter say their wealth increased by more than \u00c2\u00a3138,000. The study also looked at people's attitude towards saving and pensions. 30% of individuals reported saving for an unexpected expense, 23% reported saving for holidays or leisure, 15% for planned expenses, 10% for other people and only 10% to provide a retirement income. Among households aged 25-34, nearly one-quarter (24%) did not expect to receive any income from the state pension in retirement. However, one third expected it would be their largest source of income after retirement. Despite new legislation that automatically enrols workers into workplace pension schemes, nearly half (44%) did not expect to receive any income from a private pension. Rowena Crawford, a Senior Research Economist at the IFS and another author of the report, said: \"It is striking how many individuals do not expect private pensions to have a role in financing their retirement, let alone be their main source of income.\" \"It will be interesting to see how these attitudes change as auto enrolment into workplace pensions is rolled out.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What age groups have become richer in the UK ?", "answers": [], "id": 3030}, {"question": "What are working-age households in the UK or the UK ?", "answers": [], "id": 3031}, {"question": "What country has seen working-age households become richer ?", "answers": [], "id": 3032}, {"question": "Over what period have working-age households become richer ?", "answers": [], "id": 3033}, {"question": "What country has working-age households become richer over the past decade ?", "answers": [], "id": 3034}, {"question": "What is the source of the information on working age households ?", "answers": [], "id": 3035}, {"question": "What country has the trend of working-age households becoming richer ?", "answers": [], "id": 3036}, {"question": "Over what time period have working-age households become richer ?", "answers": [], "id": 3037}, {"question": "What is the source of the information on working-age household wealth ?", "answers": [], "id": 3038}, {"question": "What is used to describe working-age households ?", "answers": [], "id": 3039}]}], "title": "The study, by the Institute"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Rosie Ross, 16, was killed by schizophrenic Inderjit Kainth while she sunbathed in Birmingham City Centre in May 2001.

Mr Jordan is also charged with causing an explosion and belonging or professing to belong to a proscribed organisation. On Thursday, Gavin Coyle, 38, was also charged with attempting to murder the police officer. Mr Coyle, formerly of Culmore Park in Omagh, County Tyrone, but whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, also faced charges of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and membership of the IRA. A detective told Friday's hearing at Dungannon Magistrates' Court that the two men were involved in a \"joint enterprise\" to try to kill the policeman. She said that when each charge was put to Mr Jordan during police interviews, he replied: \"I am totally innocent of this fabricated charge.\" The detective added that the accused then said: \"This is yet another case of internment by remand.\" Mr Jordan had originally been arrested in connection with the bombing in the days after the attack, but was released without charge, the court heard. The detective said police believe CCTV footage captured Mr Jordan and Mr Coyle driving two vehicles in the vicinity of the officer's house prior to the bomb. A trace of nitroglycerin was also found in the boot of a car later seized by police from Mr Jordan, the detective added. She said police were opposing bail as the defendant was connected to republican paramilitary groups and could commit offences if he was bailed, adding that he also posed a flight risk. But a defence lawyer told the court the evidence linking Mr Jordan to the attack was \"non-existent\". He rejected a claim that new evidence had emerged since his client's original arrest in 2008. He said: \"This defendant should not be connected to these offences.\" Police expert analysis of the CCTV footage had not even been able to confirm the make and model of the vehicle, he said, and the car later impounded by police was not even registered to Mr Jordan. The solicitor also questioned the police's reliance on the nitroglycerin trace, saying the bomb used in the attack had been made of semtex. The judge refused Mr Jordan's application for bail.

The government said it \"strongly denied\" the allegations but that settling was a \"prudent\" decision.

It says this deters migrants from attempting the life-threatening voyage to its shores in trafficking boats. But the policy has been heavily criticised both at home and internationally, including by the United Nations. The Manus case was due to be heard in the Victoria Supreme Court on Wednesday. But shortly before the trial began, lawyers for the claimants said the government and its service providers had offered a last minute settlement of A$70m. They also offered to cover costs estimated to be more than A$20m. The full details of the settlement and the financial package are yet to be fully approved by the court. Despite the millions of dollars it has cost, and the critical headlines it has generated, the Australian government is unlikely to regret its policy of sending asylum seekers offshore. Telling refugees that they will not be allowed to enter Australia until their case has been processed seems to have been a powerful deterrent.

And with the Manus Island centre due to close in October, time is running out for a long-term solution.

Separate DfT figures suggest about 240 deaths in 2014 involved drivers over the legal alcohol limit. Officials said the rise in deaths in the year ending September 2015 was not \"statistically significant\" - meaning the increase was \"probably to do with a combination of factors that have come about by chance, rather than any specific change\".

The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. \"One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels,\" explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. \"This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically.\" She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40% increase in gas prices by 30%, electricity prices would increase by 8%. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4%. \"For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience,\" Ms Billington added.

IS militants are putting up fierce resistance, using snipers and large numbers of suicide bombers. A BBC correspondent says that although progress is slow, it is steady. Mosul, which was captured by IS in June 2014, is the jihadist group's last major urban stronghold in Iraq. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces personnel, soldiers, police, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen are involved in the offensive. In the first two weeks of the operation, they advanced rapidly from the east and south-east, seizing outlying towns and villages despite strong resistance. On 1 November, special forces and army units entered the eastern outskirts of the city at two points and were able to establish footholds there. Two weeks later, progress towards the centre is slow, reports the BBC's Richard Galpin in Irbil. IS has not shown any sign of weakening, our correspondent adds, and is using snipers and large numbers of suicide bombers to pin down troops in densely populated areas where manoeuvring armoured vehicles is not easy. The militants are also reported to be using civilians as human shields. And forces advancing from the north and south have still not entered the city. Our correspondent says that unless there is a sudden collapse in the resistance now being put up by IS, the battle for Mosul is likely to continue for weeks. The UN has warned that in areas retaken by Iraqi forces, civilian infrastructure such as water and power plants, schools and hospitals are damaged and medical services are often unavailable. Families are going hungry due to lost livelihoods, disrupted food production and supply, and food prices are rising at markets, it said. Many people are being forced to drink untreated water from wells, while children are going unvaccinated and are unable to go to school. Almost 59,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, about 26,000 of them children.

A German court rejected an appeal against his jail term and a medical expert said he was fit to serve his sentence at a \"suitable\" facility. During his trial, Boere had admitted to the killings in 1944, but said he had been acting on orders from his superiors. He shot dead Fritz Bicknese, a chemist and father of 12; Frans Kusters, a Dutch resistance member who owned a bicycle shop; and Teun de Groot, who helped Jews go into hiding. Boere argued that he risked being sent to a concentration camp if he refused to carry out the shootings. \"At no time in 1944 did I act with the feeling that I was committing a crime,\" he told the court during his trial, but added that 65 years later he saw things from a different perspective. The presiding judge, Gerd Nohl, said all three killings had been carried out \"on a totally random basis\" and constituted murder. Boere was born in Germany to a Dutch father and a German mother but grew up in the Dutch town of Maastricht. He joined the Waffen SS when the Nazis overran his hometown in 1940. In 1947 he escaped from a prisoner of war camp in the Netherlands and returned to Germany. A tribunal in Amsterdam sentenced him to death for the killings in his absence in 1949, but this was later commuted to life in prison. He was never extradited and a German court ruled in the 1980s that the Dutch trial had been unfair because Boere had not been present.

A statement released on Tuesday says that \"in the absence of responses from the Venezuelan authorities to requests for access, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein deployed a team of human rights officers to conduct remote monitoring of the human rights situation in the country \". The UN human rights team conducted interviews remotely because its requests for access went unanswered by the Venezuelan authorities. Witnesses told the UN that the Venezuelan security forces had fired tear gas and buckshot without warning. \"Security forces have reportedly also resorted to the use of deadly force against demonstrators,\" the statement reads. \"Since the wave of demonstrations began in April, there has been a clear pattern of excessive force used against protesters. Several thousand people have been arbitrarily detained, many reportedly subjected to ill-treatment and even torture, while several hundred have been brought before military rather than civilian courts,\" Mr Hussein said. He pointed out that \"some groups of demonstrators have also resorted to violence, with attacks reported against security officers\". The UN human rights team said that estimates suggested that more than 5,000 people had been arbitrarily detained between 1 April, when the protests began, and 31 July. The high commissioner urged the Venezuelan authorities \"to immediately end the excessive use of force against demonstrators, to halt arbitrary detentions and to release all those arbitrarily detained\".

The court had sentenced him to 15 months in prison and barred him from office in the early hours of Tuesday. The court said Ram\u00f3n Muchacho had failed to prevent barricades from being erected during anti-government protests held in Chacao, the opposition stronghold he governs. After a nine-hour debate, the Supreme Court found Mr Muchacho, 44, guilty of failing to enforce a court order on preventing the blocking of roads. Chacao has been one of the neighbourhoods in the capital, Caracas, at the centre of anti-government protests that have swept through Venezuela in the past four months. It is a gathering point for demonstrations and its roads are often blocked by \"trancones\", blockades organised by the opposition to show their rejection of the government. On 24 May, after eight weeks of anti-government protests, the Supreme Court ordered Mr Muchacho and seven other mayors to prevent barricades being erected, and where roads had been blocked, to remove the obstacles. The court warned that if the mayors did not follow the order, they could face between six and 15 months in jail.

After hammering Derry at Navan two weeks ago, Meath were favourites heading into the Pairc Esler contest but the Mournemen produced a performance of grit and determination to chisel out the vital Division Two victory. Murphy's goal, as he flicked a mishit Darragh O'Hanlon free past Paddy O'Rourke, was the perfect start for the home side as they were never headed in the contest. With midfielder Peter Turley putting himself about and former under-age star Mooney producing his best game in the Down senior jersey, the home side pushed on from leading only 1-1 to 0-3 to move five ahead by the interval. O'Hanlon slotted three first-half frees while the impressive Conor Maginn, Barry O'Hagan (two), Ryan Johnston and Aidan Carr also got on the scoresheet for Down in the opening period. Fresh from his Sigerson Cup heroics with St Mary's, Kevin McKernan also excelled in the opening period for the Mournement as Meath laboured, with free-taker Donal Lenihan hitting three of their points. A McKernan point extended Down's lead to 1-11 to 0-8 by the 52nd minute after a great block at the other end by Carr had prevented Brian Menton for netting a Meath goal. After their struggles in recent times, it was not a surprise to see Down attempting to hold on to their lead in the closing stages and Meath, helped by the introduction of the speedy Eamonn Wallace, reduced the margin to three by the time the game entered injury time. Inevitably, there was a late scare for Down as Lenihan aimed for goal from his last-gasp 13-metre free and the ball skimmed off the crossbar over for a point before the final whistle was blown seconds later.

The 50 mark separates manufacturing growth from contraction, with the sector now just on the positive side. Manufacturing failed to boost overall UK growth during 2015 and early 2016. UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \"The manufacturing sector looks likely to act as an increased drag on the economy in the second quarter. \"There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum are weighing on investment spending and business decision-making in general.\" The report found that more than a third of manufacturers surveyed believed uncertainty over the EU vote has had an impact on their business, with 8% saying the effect was \"strongly detrimental\". The survey showed the investment goods industry experienced a difficult month, with production falling at the quickest pace since early 2013. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the manufacturing sector was \"essentially at a standstill in May\". Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small improvement for manufacturing in May did little to change the fundamental picture of a struggling industrial sector. \"Granted, the headline PMI index recovered from its three-year low in April, ticking up from an upwardly revised 49.4 to 50.1 in May, above the consensus expectation of 49.6,\" she said. Ms Miller said this was still far below the average since the economic recovery picked up at the start of 2013. However, she thought the situation would \"improve for UK manufacturers later this year\". Overall new orders rose in May.

He has been charged with practising without a medical licence, and theft, after allegedly stealing and forging three cheques from an elderly woman who sought treatment for stomach pain. In a brief media conference on Wednesday evening, he said he was \"deeply saddened and a little disrespected\" by the accusations and asked for privacy. Mr Love-Robinson has since insisted in media interviews that he has certifications to practise alternative medicine, including naturopathy. Scans of certificates from the American Alternative Medical Association and American Association of Drugless Practitioners had previously been posted to his Facebook page, which now appears to have been taken down. But the state of Florida no longer offers naturopathy licenses and only licensed doctors are allowed to offer such services in the state. Mr Love-Robinson said he became interested in alternative medicine while suffering from illnesses during childhood. According to the Palm Beach Post, he claims to suffer from the auto-immune disease lupus, while a post on his Facebook page earlier this month said he was suffering from kidney cancer. The Palm Beach County sheriff's office says Mr Love-Robinson examined an 86-year-old in December who suffered from severe stomach pain. He allegedly diagnosed her with arthritis and sold her vitamins, receiving more than $3,000 (\u00c2\u00a32,090) for a series of home visits.

He also suggests opening car parks longer and introducing a premium service for bulky item collections to raise funds. The proposals will be discussed by the city council's cabinet on 24 February. Mr Anderson said reducing council call centre hours could save \u00a32.9m and cutting the number of One Stop Shops - where people can get advice on council services or pay their council tax - could draw back \u00a32.7m. However, he said that would mean it will \"take people longer to get a response to requests for some services\". His plan sets out a saving of \u00a34.1m in children's services, which would be achieved by reducing the cost of care placements and packages by using fewer independent foster agencies. It also includes reducing the cost of the city's economic development agency, Liverpool Vision, by \u00a31.2m and reviewing of the city's library provision to save \u00a31.6m - a move which could see several close. The budget also proposes a 4.99% council tax increase - the mayor previously suggested a one-off rise of 10% but that was rejected by Liverpool residents during a public consultation. Mr Anderson said the cuts would mean job losses, stating that there was \"no doubt that some frontline council services will be significantly reduced and we will have less staff by 2020\". \"These are not things that we want to do, but we have no choice, because the government isn't listening,\" he said. Joe Anderson's set out his budget, which would save \u00a390m. Big cuts to adult social care have been minimised - for the moment at least - and the impact of paying the national living wage has turned out to be less costly than was originally budgeted for. The city has also made money through the mayor's flagship Invest To Earn programme, which is generating \u00a33m a year. New homes are generating an additional \u00a38m per year in council tax revenue - an amount that could rise with the building of executive homes in south Liverpool, as the vast majority of the city's housing stock is currently in the lowest bands. Mr Anderson says he's setting up a task force to consider the future of the city's libraries - he expects about four will have to close in order to make the savings - and there is also doubt over the future of the One Stop Shops.

Asked about the dropping of the commitment to hold a referendum before Wales gets income tax powers, he told the MPs: \"Tax is an absolutely essential part of devolution policy.\" He added: This is about mature, accountable devolution.\" He said he intended to have a fiscal framework agreed with the Welsh Government before the Wales Bill becomes law. Asked about funding, he said: \"There are no plans to change the Barnett Formula.\" He said the funding floor introduced by the government meant funding per head was set at around 115 % of the English average. On the steel industry, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said that there were some concerns about the possible joint venture of ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel Europe. Mr Cairns said: \"ThyssenKrupp are prepared to invest significant sums of money into a joint venture scheme with the offer of support from the UK government, and that in itself we can take encouragement from because that shows they're prepared to spend money.\" He said taxpayers' money would only be used if there was a viable sustainable future in steelmaking.

Some who camped scratched their names into the glass of the church windows. The names are still visible today. A descendant of one of the infants fed from the decanter has handed it into the care of Inverness Museum. Donald MacMillan's grandmother Christina Ross was the daughter of John Ross, a shepherd who with his family and others was cleared from the estate. They set up a temporary camp at Croick Church in Sutherland in May 1845. The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands. With help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother. She and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel. Those who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum. Jim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter. To mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August. Prof Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times. Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer. Landowners were seeking to \"improve\" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. The clearances have influenced the stories of two new films. Slow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June. Its plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross. The second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony. Once in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes.

But the prototype developed by a UK-Chinese team overcomes a key hurdle to their commercial development by taking inspiration from the gut. Details appear in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. Scientists are tackling the challenge of improving battery technology using a variety of different approaches; this is one of them. One of the problems hindering the commercial development of lithium-sulphur-based devices has been the degradation of the batteries caused by the loss of active materials within. To overcome this problem, the researchers developed a lightweight layer with nano-scale structure which resembles the villi - finger-like protrusions which line the small intestine. In humans, villi are used to absorb the products of digestion and increase the surface area across which this process can take place. In the new lithium-sulphur battery, a layer of material with a villi-like structure, made from tiny zinc oxide wires, is placed on the surface of one of the battery's electrodes. This can trap fragments of the active material when they break off, keeping them accessible for ongoing reactions and allowing the material to be reused. \"It's a tiny thing, this layer, but it's important,\" said study co-author Dr Paul Coxon from the University of Cambridge's department of materials science and metallurgy. \"This gets us a long way through the bottleneck which is preventing the development of better batteries.\" The researchers say that, if hurdles to commercial development can be overcome, lithium-sulphur batteries could have five times the energy density of the lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other electronics. But as lithium-sulphur batteries discharge, sulphur molecules transform into chain-like structures known as poly-sulphides. As the devices undergo several charge-discharge cycles, bits of the poly-sulphide go into the battery's electrolyte (the electrically-conducting solution), so that over time the battery loses active material. \"This is the first time a chemically functional layer with a well-organised nano-architecture has been proposed to trap and reuse the dissolved active materials during battery charging and discharging,\" said lead author Teng Zhao, a PhD student from Cambridge. \"By taking our inspiration from the natural world, we were able to come up with a solution that we hope will accelerate the development of next-generation batteries.\" The device is currently a proof of principle; commercially-available lithium-sulphur batteries are still some years away. Additionally, while the number of times the battery can be charged and discharged has been improved, it is still not able to go through as many charge cycles as a lithium-ion battery. But the researchers point out that, given a lithium-sulphur battery does not need to be charged as often as a lithium-ion battery, it may be the case that the increase in energy density cancels out the lower total number of charge-discharge cycles.", "qas": [{"question": "Who has developed a battery which mimics the structure of the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3520}, {"question": "What did scientists create that replicas of the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3521}, {"question": "What is used to simulate the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3522}, {"question": "Who have developed a battery which mimics the structure of the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3523}, {"question": "What does the battery mimic in the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3524}, {"question": "Who developed a battery that mimics the structure of the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3525}, {"question": "Who has developed a battery that mimics the structure of the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3526}, {"question": "What is used to mimic the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3527}, {"question": "Who developed a battery which mimics the structure of the small intestine ?", "answers": [], "id": 3528}, {"question": "Scientists have developed a battery that mimics the structure of what ?", "answers": [], "id": 3529}]}], "title": "It's a type of battery"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "South African firm Famous Brands signed a \u00a3120m deal to buy the chain from Nando's owner, Capricorn Ventures.

The company says that it wants to open 10 to 15 more burger restaurants a year in the UK. The mass-market burger giants, McDonalds and Burger King, first opened in the UK in the 1970s. While those brands have continued to expand, by the end of the 1990s a new fashion for more expensive burgers had arrived, again from the US.

Julian Blazeby, the IPCC's director of major investigations, said: \"We continue to receive referrals on police actions in child sexual abuse cases from forces across the country. \"The IPCC is committed to investigating the most sensitive and serious incidents of alleged police wrongdoing and many child sexual abuse cases fall within that remit.\" Some of the cases date back decades and include damaging claims that investigations were brought to a halt despite evidence of abuse being uncovered. In Rotherham, the 2014 report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed police suppressed evidence of the widespread sexual abuse of teenagers and failed to arrest the abusers. In London, allegations also centre on investigations being halted and evidence suppressed. They include claims that investigations were shut down prematurely or prosecutions not pursued because the suspects were politicians. However, in May 2016 one claim - that a prosecution was stopped when a defendant threatened to name the former prime minister, Sir Edward Heath, as an abuser - was dismissed by the IPCC.

Last week, chief executive Vittorio Colao told the BBC - ahead of the referendum vote - that Britain risked exclusion from plans for a giant new single market in digital services if it left the EU.

He will also answer some questions sent in by listeners ahead of the recording. \"I will describe the remarkable properties of black holes, including the fact that very small black holes aren't black at all, but glow like hot bodies,\" he said. \"We should never stop trying to tell these extraordinary stories from science, and I hope my Reith Lecture will enthuse a new generation to develop ideas that will have an impact on our understanding of the world and never to be overwhelmed by the task of discovery.\" The BBC Reith Lectures began in 1948, with a talk by philosopher Bertrand Russell. Last year, surgeon Atul Gawande examined the future of medicine. Past lecturers include artist Grayson Perry, politician Aung San Suu Kyi and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Prof Hawking's lecture coincides with BBC Radio 4's plans to mark the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. BBC Radio 4 controller Gwyneth Williams, who announced the new season along with BBC director general Tony Hall, said: \"I know that our discriminating audience will be inspired by Prof Hawking's magnificent challenge \"never to stop trying to tell\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 extraordinary stories from science\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and never to be overwhelmed by the task of discovery'.\" The rest of the season includes:. Double Oscar winner Glenda Jackson's return to acting after more than two decades in politics comes in an adaptation of Emile Zola's 20-volume novel series Les Rougon-Macquart. Entitled Blood, Sex And Money, the series is described as \"a multi-stranded immersive experience that draws us into 19th Century France\". There will be three seasons, broadcast at six-monthly intervals, with the first beginning on 21 November. Jackson is cast as 104-year-old Adelaide Fouque alongside Robert Lindsay, Georgina Campbell, Fenella Woolgar and Ian Hart. Late Night Woman's Hour sees Lauren Laverne join the Woman's Hour team in August for a special series containing \"mischievous and unbridled\" conversation, during which she will share presenting duties with Jane Garvey.

He said he made the allegations verbally to the Right Reverend Peter Burrows, the Bishop of Doncaster; the Right Reverend Steven Croft, the former Bishop of Sheffield, and now Bishop of Oxford; and the Right Reverend Martyn Snow, a former Archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham, and now the Bishop of Leicester, between July 2012 and February 2013.

Polar bear cubs were last born in the UK almost 25 years ago. Arktos is one of two male bears at the park at Kincraig in the Cairngorms National Park. The pair could remain together for about two weeks. Arktos will eventually return to an enclosure he shares with the other male, Walker. RZSS said captive breeding was an important part of a wider effort to conserve polar bears, which are classified as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. However, animal welfare organisations OneKind Scotland and Born Free Foundation have said tackling climate change to better protect wild bears should be the focus of conservation efforts rather than captive breeding. RZSS, which also manages Edinburgh Zoo where efforts have been made to breed giant pandas, said Arktos and Victoria have mated several times so far. The society said the pair would live together for the next week or two \"mimicking what would occur naturally in the wild\". Vickie Larkin, head carnivore keeper at the park, said the pair had appeared to have bonded well since being introduced. She said: \"Both polar bears have really warmed to each other and all the signs are really positive. \"From the first moment they met, Arktos has been really gentle with Victoria and their bond has been immediate. \"Polar bear breeding is inherently complex as the species are induced ovulators, meaning that the female only releases an egg after initial mating occurs. They also practice delayed implantation, where the egg doesn't implant into the uterine wall until some months later.\" Ms Larkin added: \"If successful, Victoria will not fall pregnant until August to September time. \"Other key stages are her entering the birthing den in October to November and potentially giving birth in December to January. Any cubs would then not come out of the birthing den until March to April 2017.\" Arktos arrived at the park in April 2012 from a zoo in Hannover, Germany. When being given health checks, park staff talk to Arktos in German, the language he heard when he was in the zoo in Hannover.

Researchers included bonuses, pension contributions and redundancy payments, as well as salaries, in the sums. The Taxpayers' Alliance said some of the figures were concerning. In particular, the lobby group highlighted the sums being paid to senior managers. The overwhelming majority of staff on six-figure salaries were clinical, including GPs, hospital consultants and dentists. But nearly 2,400 of the staff were employed by NHS bodies in the UK in non-clinical roles - of these 472 earned more than \u00a3150,000. The Daily Mail said its analysis of annual accounts of NHS bodies showed that the pay bill for NHS directors had risen by 22% in two years. Another 534 employees of quangos were also on six-figure salaries. Taxpayers' Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: \"No-one begrudges paying doctors and nurses well for the tough jobs they do, but it's galling to see bosses at failing hospitals continuing to rake in the cash. \"It's an insult to taxpayers, but it's even worse for patients who have suffered because of mismanagement and worse. \"The rewards-for-failure culture is rife in the NHS and it must be stamped out as a matter of urgency.\" However, separate figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre have shown that overall the number of managers in the health service in England, including senior and lower level ones, has been falling. There are now just over 37,600 employed - down by nearly a fifth in five years. Ministers in England also pointed out that they had written to NHS bodies to discourage \"retire and rehire\" practices where staff get lucrative pay-offs and then start working again in closely linked jobs, while any salaries above the level of the prime minister's now needed to be scrutinised by the Department of Health. Health Minister David Prior said: \"We are absolutely clear that value for money for the taxpayer is vital, every pound that is wasted or spent unnecessarily is a pound that cannot be spent on looking after patients.\" Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, defended the pay levels, saying being a chief executive in the NHS \"was one of the toughest jobs in the country\".

She was officially the last person born in the 1800s still living. She had attributed her longevity to her genetics and a diet of three eggs a day, two of them raw. Ms Morano was the oldest of eight siblings, all of whom she has outlived. She died at her home in the northern city of Verbania. Her life not only spanned three centuries but also survived an abusive marriage, the loss of her only son, two World Wars and more than 90 Italian governments. Ms Morano had admitted that her longevity was partly down to genetics: her mother reached 91 and several sisters reached their centenary. But it was also down to a rather unusual diet of three eggs - two raw - each day for more than 90 years. It was a regime she took up as a young woman, after the doctor diagnosed her with anaemia shortly after World War One. She had cut down to just two eggs a day, and a few biscuits recently. Her doctor of 27 years, Carlo Bava, had told AFP news agency that she rarely ate vegetables or fruit. \"When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner.\" Ms Morano also credited her longevity to her decision, in 1938, to kick out her husband - a year after her baby boy died at just six months old. The marriage had never been healthy, she said. She had been in love with a boy who was killed during World War One, and had no interest in marrying someone else. But, she told La Stampa newspaper in an interview when she was a spritely 112 that she was left with little choice. \"He told me: 'If you're lucky you marry me, or I'll kill you'. I was 26 years old. I got married.\" Eventually, it became too much. Though they separated in 1938, they remained married until he died in 1978. Ms Morano, who worked until she was 75, chose never to marry again. \"I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,\" she told the New York Times. She had only taken on a full-time carer a couple of years ago - but had not left her small two-room apartment for 20 years.

This week, the think tank Policy Exchange said the average household energy bill has risen by \u00c2\u00a3120 over the last five years due to what they called \"ill-thought through energy and climate policies\". A spokeswoman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said:. \"Reducing energy bills for hard-working British families and businesses is this government's priority.

Data showed that average store prices rose by 2.8% over the year, which the ONS said was the largest increase since March 2012.

There are two words that sum that up: global and digital. First let us consider global. Businesses are increasingly organised so that their supply chains and markets extend across national borders. This means that events which happen in one part of the world can have important effects on businesses everywhere. So, it is vital for business journalists to steer away from closed-economy thinking. Understanding and explaining the connections between consumers, producers, and policymakers in different countries is now essential to covering the beat. Second, we are in the midst of a digital revolution when it comes to the way news is reported and delivered to audiences. I am not predicting that the end of TV and radio listings is right around the corner, but viewers increasingly want to watch and listen at a time when they want to. I found this with my own programme, Talking Business with Linda Yueh, where many UK viewers watched via BBC iPlayer. Outside the UK, where the BBC's on demand service was not available, the programme had multiple showings through the week. It is inevitable that this trend will continue. The challenge for business reporting in the digital age, though, goes beyond simply making content more easily available online to suit viewer habits. The prevalence of social media and the internet combined with smart phones mean that people have a huge amount of information available at their fingertips. News audiences are now more informed than ever before, especially in business. When news is reported in mainstream media, for many it is no longer new. Personally, I often find news items from social media and other online sources faster than traditional ones. Therefore, business news should look to add value for its audience in terms of relevant and rigorous analysis rather than just the reporting of events. It should be a trusted source among the many sources of information from which the viewer can choose. Being global and digital are what I have tried to achieve in the last two years.

But the First Bus doctor was aware this happened while he was at the wheel of the bus. Six people died and 15 others were injured when the Glasgow City Council bin lorry veered out of control on Queen Street before crashing into the Millennium Hotel in George Square in December 2014. The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court is examining Mr Clarke's health, the condition of the lorry and the route taken. The court had previously heard that following the 2010 blackout when he was a bus driver, Mr Clarke was examined by Dr Kenneth Lyons, the medical advisor to First Bus. Dr Lyons subsequently sent a letter to Mr Clarke's own GP, which described how his loss of consciousness took place on a stationary bus and asked for further advice. Mr Clarke's GP, Dr Gerard McKaig, told the inquiry that the driver had said to him that he had fainted in the First Bus canteen. After he went on annual leave, Dr Lyons received a response to his letter from a Dr John Langan, who worked at the same practice as Dr McKaig. The letter said Mr Clarke had been \"waiting for his lunch in a hot environment\" when he fainted, and the driver was \"unlikely to have another one\". It concluded Mr Clarke was \"fit to return to work as a bus driver\". On Tuesday, the inquiry heard a second day of evidence from Dr Neville, a GP in Dundee, who also prepares expert reports on drivers' fitness to drive. He prepared a report on Mr Clarke after the bin lorry crash. Dr Neville told the inquiry that the \"major discrepancy\" in reports about the 2010 episode should have been caught by doctors. The expert witness said the letter that came back from Mr Clarke's GP's surgery lacked the detail or thoroughness you would expect from a healthcare professional. He said the First Bus doctor should have noted the major discrepancy in the account of the 2010 blackout and he should have got in touch with the other doctor. Dr Neville said that if either doctor had noted the discrepancy in Mr Clarke's account, an inquiry into the exact facts would have resulted. Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the bin lorry crash.

Britannia's chief executive Bob Downie said: \"To be the best in Scotland once is a fantastic achievement, but to do this for 10 consecutive years is a phenomenal tribute to our staff who go the extra mile to ensure that all our visitors have a great experience when they visit Britannia. \"The true test of any great organisation is consistency of performance, delivering great value for time and money, year in year out, and there is no doubt that our pioneering approach to providing great customer experiences has underpinned our success.\" Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland's chief executive, said: \"I'd like to congratulate Britannia on this fantastic achievement, which demonstrates an outstanding commitment to quality and excellence in every aspect of the business. \"Retaining the accolade of Scotland's best attraction for 10 years running, Britannia is setting the standards for tourism in Scotland, and it is a real testament to the total commitment shown by their staff to consistently deliver a world-leading customer experience.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What is Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3980}, {"question": "How many years in a row has Britannia been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3981}, {"question": "How long has Britian been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3982}, {"question": "How many years in a row has Britania been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3983}, {"question": "For how many years in a row has Britania been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3984}, {"question": "For how many years in a row has Britannia been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3985}, {"question": "How long has Britannia been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3986}, {"question": "How many years in a row has Britiania been named Scotland 's best tourist attraction ?", "answers": [], "id": 3987}, {"question": "What country is Britania located in ?", "answers": [], "id": 3988}, {"question": "What country is Britannia located in ?", "answers": [], "id": 3989}]}], "title": "And this year the yacht"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Freetown, at the stroke of midnight - marking 42 days without a single declared case of the disease. There were further cheers when the WHO local representative made the official announcement later on Saturday. The outbreak killed almost 4,000 people in Sierra Leone over the past 18 months. 11,315. Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected. (Includes one in the US and six in Mali) 4,809 Liberia. 3,955 Sierra Leone. 2,536 Guinea. 8 Nigeria. Many gathered around a giant cotton tree in the centre of the city. Some lit candles in memory of the victims, while others danced with joy. Dr Oliver Johnson, from the King's Sierra Leone partnership, worked at an Ebola clinic in Freetown, and has strong links with medical professionals there. \"[For] everyone I've spoken to, there's a sense of relief that this might finally be over and maybe a bit of disbelief that after so many false starts, or false ends, we might finally be there,\" he told the BBC. A country is considered free of human-to-human transmission once two 21-day incubation periods have passed since the last known case tested negative for a second time. This is the moment Sierra Leone has been waiting for. Thousands of people took to the streets of the capital on the run-up to midnight. Women's groups came together to organise a march through the city centre; the final point was a 600-year-old cotton tree which sits on a huge roundabout. Usually, the area is jammed with cars, but last night it was packed with people. Some held up candles, others jumped around dancing and a military band led the procession through the city. There were waves of celebrations, and then silence as names of some of the dead were beamed on to a screen. Health workers in particular were honoured for their bravery and sacrifice, they were some of the first to die when Ebola struck. Today is an enormous milestone for Sierra Leoneans, and people are overjoyed. But this historic moment is bittersweet. Ebola: Mapping the outbreak. How Ebola changed the world. Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma is due to address crowds in the city later. On Friday, he blamed the WHO for delaying Sierra Leone declaring a state of emergency and restricting movement during the Ebola outbreak. He said his government did at the time what it could do and did not have the knowledge to fight the disease. He said his government had to put up with the delays because international organisations such as the WHO \"were the experts\". Neighbouring Liberia was declared Ebola-free in September following 4,800 deaths there. A handful of cases are still being reported in neighbouring Guinea.

The Russian state \"is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot\" and had \"reasons aplenty\" for wishing him \"not only harm, but death\", he said. UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko, 43, in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing. Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium-210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi. He died in hospital nearly three weeks later. The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation, Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks. He said: \"The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko's murder.\" However, he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder. Defecting to the UK in 2000, after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption, could have been seen as \"akin to treachery\", he said. He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko's \"many personal attacks on Putin\". Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known, and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death. He said: \"The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage. They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise. \"We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners.\" Mr Horwell said the suspects left a \"trail of polonium\" behind and they had \"no credible answer\" to the scientific evidence against them. While the force wanted them tried for murder, this was now unlikely to happen, the inquiry heard. Attempts to extradite the two men have failed and they remain in Russia.

He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers. But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues. The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed. More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen. Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes. \"There have been a couple of incidents where I had to contact ISPs to report things that were serious,\" he told the BBC. The audit found a variety of problems, including passwords stored in plain text, exposed code that would allow hackers to inject their own code on to ISPs' websites and, potentially load malware on to them, and issues with encryption certificates that meant Mr Moore could apply for them from the certificate authority and pose as the webmaster for a set of ISP-owned websites. Mr Moore said he was impressed by most of the ISPs's responses when he raised the issues with them. \"Ordinarily they would not be so open and honest with me but, after what happened at TalkTalk, they have been stepping in quickly,\" said Mr Moore. \"On one occasion I notified BT and PlusNet about a bug at 14:00 and they kept people back until 22:00 to fix it.\" But, he added, TalkTalk was yet to contact him. TalkTalk did supply a statement to the BBC saying it had \"integrated Paul Moore's comments into an ongoing programme of work\". \"We constantly run vulnerability checks using industry-standard third party tools. The vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not picked up by this testing, and if it had been, we would clearly have acted on that information straightaway to secure our system,\" it added. Sky told the BBC: \"We take our customers' security very seriously. We constantly review our systems and we have robust, independently assessed protocols in place to make sure customer information is as secure as possible.\" Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey University, said he was shocked by the findings. \"TalkTalk still has problems and others have not dissimilar ones,\" he said. \"I find it very surprising that after the TalkTalk hack, they [the six ISPs] still appear not to be attending to the basics.

A reward of 15m Mexican pesos ($800,000; \u00a3650,000) had been offered for information leading to his arrest. Officials did not reveal how they located Mr Yarrington. The attorney-general's office in Mexico said Mr Yarrington would be extradited to his homeland within days. He is also wanted by the United States on charges of money laundering. According to the US indictment, Mr Yarrington allegedly received large bribes from major drug traffickers operating in Tamaulipas, including the Gulf and the Zetas cartels. In return, Mr Yarrington allegedly allowed the cartels \"to operate their large-scale, multi-tonne enterprises freely, which included the smuggling of large quantities of drugs to the US for distribution\". Prosecutors say the bribes started when Mr Yarrington was running for governor and continued during his time in office, when he allegedly started investing the money in properties across the US border in Texas. The indictment also accuses him of accepting cocaine in exchange for facilitating access to Mexican ports. Before he went on the run, Mr Yarrington, who was a member of the governing PRI party before being expelled, said the charges against him were politically motivated. He was not the only Mexican governor on the run. Former Veracruz governor Javier Duarte, who is wanted on corruption charges, has been missing since October.

But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in.\" The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice. The guidance on the form highlights that it is \"not normally necessary\" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with. But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are \"unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it\". The older version of the form left a space for so-called \"co-respondents\" to be named where appropriate. \"The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',\" Ms Hamblin explained. \"This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse.\" If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case. They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs. According to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015. Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. \"Unreasonable behaviour\" accounted for 46,815. Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery \"want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them\". \"But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,\" she said. \"Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings.\" When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons:.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"It has always been possible for a petitioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms. \"As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so.

Even the finance minister Jane Hutt couldn't resist having a swipe at the hundreds of millions of pounds in their coffers, before telling Good Morning Wales why she is rolling back on the proposed cutbacks because of concerns over part-time teaching and scientific research. Ministers stressed it was a draft budget and, like all drafts, it was open to consultation before changes were made. Be that as it may, there is clearly strong feeling within government that not only can universities afford it, but that their time has come to take a hit after further education colleges took one last year. Universities insist the reserves are needed for investment to continue and for the sector in Wales to remain internationally competitive. The stand-off between ministers and vice-chancellors was beginning to develop. Opposition parties were frustrated that while many of the higher education bosses were lobbying them heavily, they weren't doing so publicly, with the exception of Professor Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff university. But nevertheless it was clear that universities weren't happy, and it was adding to the simmering resentment that had already developed over the government's university tuition fee policy. In fact, the general cut and the tuition fees policy became enmeshed because the Welsh government had argued that much of the cash reduction was in fact staying in the system because the money was being re-directed to fee subsidies, rather than going directly to the institutions. The comeback from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was that only around 60% of the tuition fee grants will stay in Wales as the fees follow the students, wherever they choose to go. In the end, a political decision was taken not to get involved in a scrap with vice-chancellors. As we head into an election campaign, there's an argument to say it would have been a huge distraction but also a potential opportunity for the Welsh government to show it wasn't afraid to make unpopular decisions.

Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped.

The club says that 50,000 tickets were redistributed through their exchange last season, with 44,000 so far this season. The general resale of football tickets was banned in 1994 because of safety fears over the possibility of rival fans mingling together. Only outlets officially authorised by clubs can offer unwanted seats, with Everton and Tottenham having deals with one firm, Stubhub. Another website, Twickets, has a deal with Crystal Palace where tickets cannot be sold for more than face value.

The counterfeit medicines contained only a fraction of the correct dosage. They included Zyprexa, a medicine to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Andrew Marshall, prosecuting, said patients had been put at risk by his fraud. \"This case is considered to represent the most serious breach of the medicine control regime - it's the most serious breach that has happened in the EU,\" he told jurors. \"It has had far-reaching effects for the pharmaceutical industry, control mechanisms, patients and the confidence of the public.\" The case arose from a \u00a3750,000 three-and-a-half-year investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Many people in the Russian-backed region are unhappy with the ailing economy and lack of reforms. But Abkhazian nationalist feeling is also fuelling the unrest. By Michael CecireForeign Policy Research Institute. The 2014 Sochi Olympics were billed as a way of boosting the economy by bringing tourism to Abkhazia or sourcing materials for construction, but the most noticeable effect was actually a source of frustration: the expanded security cordon that penetrated beyond the Russia-Abkhazia border. Some economic problems can certainly be attributed to the de facto government, but it is Russia that has the real power to improve conditions. For example, the Moscow-financed building boom in Chechnya has improved material conditions (even if human rights remain a deep problem), but nothing comparable has happened in Abkhazia. However, the opposition's chief point of contention is Alexander Ankvab's more liberal (relatively speaking) policy towards ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia. He has advocated more fully integrating them, granting them Abkhazian \"citizenship\". The opposition has painted this as a purely political ploy to expand his electoral base and say it could endanger Abkhazia's ethnic Abkhazian identity. Analysis: Unrest in Abkhazia. The protesters are led by Raul Khadzhimba, a former prime minister and vice-president of Abkhazia, who was defeated by Mr Ankvab in elections in August 2011. The Black Sea coastal region is recognised as a state only by Russia and a few other countries. It broke away from Georgia after a civil war more than 20 years ago and declared formal independence in 2008. Since then, it has relied militarily and financially on Russia. Russia is reportedly sending two senior officials, presidential aide Vladislav Surkov and deputy security council secretary Rashid Nurgaliyev, to Sukhumi in response to the crisis. Opinion among the opposition is said to be divided between those who want Abkhazia to rely less on Russia and those who instead want it to become part of Russia. Mr Ankvab accused the opposition of attempting a coup on Tuesday and said the security forces remained \"loyal to the state\" and were \"taking measures to stabilise the situation\". Raul Khadzhimba defended the protests, saying: \"Over all the years of his rule the president did not allow anybody in his circle to do their work. \"He took upon himself everybody's responsibilities on their behalf, whether he should or should not have been doing this. That led to our country in fact becoming an authoritarian regime.

It works by using information from victims to identify violence hotspots, such as in nightclubs and parks. The method has already been adopted by Western Cape in South Africa and Milwaukee in the USA. The man behind it, Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's School of Dentistry, said there was no reason it could not work anywhere in the world. One of the most significant breakthroughs was the sharing of information and joint action by police, councils and emergency departments to try to curb violence. Every time someone comes through accident and emergency with any sort of injury where alcohol is a contributory factor the police are informed. It is claimed that the approach has reduced hospital admissions for violence by 42% in Cardiff, relative to 13 similar cities in Wales and England. More than 100 hospitals across Wales and England have since copied Cardiff. \"It's very low tech and the basic requirements are that the police and local government and health meet from time to time in an organised way,\" Prof Shepherd said. \"That's not rocket science, so we think this is applicable widely, including poor countries [and] low and middle income countries. \"We would very much like to see this implemented in a country like Nigeria, Uganda or South American countries where there's a lot of violence. \"It's in the World Health Organisation-recommended approach but it's easier said than done.\" Prof Shepherd, who was a surgeon at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, started his work in 1996 after realising that a great deal of violence which resulted in hospital treatment was not known to the police because victims did not report it. He also noticed trends in the types of facial injuries he was treating. Patients were being regularly admitted who had been glassed, and one early success was putting pressure on clubs and city centre pubs to adopt plastic glasses. The move brought about an immediate decline in facial injuries connected to alcohol. However, there were continuing problems with drink-related crimes in the city so Prof Shepherd and his violence and society research group continued their innovative approach. The research group's research into violence, alcohol and late-night safety was recognised with a Queen's Anniversary Prize for excellence in higher education in 2009. Amsterdam decided to adopt the approach after a delegation from the city, including the chief inspector of the police force, visited Cardiff last year. Hidde Toet, from the Dutch Consumer Safety Institute and who led the delegation, said after the visit: \"The Cardiff model provides us with an effective method to improve the way we share information and implement preventative measures by police and local government to effectively reduce violence.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What does Amsterdam take a city-wide approach to dealing with ?", "answers": [], "id": 4460}, {"question": "What city has been first in the world to adopt a city-wide approach to violence ?", "answers": [], "id": 4461}, {"question": "What city was the first in the world to adopt a city-wide approach to violence ?", "answers": [], "id": 4462}, {"question": "What city has been the first in the world to adopt a city-wide approach to violence ?", "answers": [], "id": 4463}, {"question": "Where does Amsterdam rank in terms of city-wide initiatives against violence ?", "answers": [], "id": 4464}, {"question": "Where does Amsterdam rank as far as taking violence seriously in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 4465}, {"question": "What is the first city in the world to tackle violence city-wide ?", "answers": [], "id": 4466}, {"question": "WhatCity-wide approach to tackling violence has been adopted by which city ?", "answers": [], "id": 4467}, {"question": "Where does Amsterdam rank in terms of city-wide approaches to violence reduction ?", "answers": [], "id": 4468}, {"question": "What does Amsterdam use a city-wide approach to dealing with ?", "answers": [], "id": 4469}]}], "title": "It is adopting a Cardiff"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders. Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists. For example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests. Habitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available. Competition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive. \"Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species,\" said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter. \"But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year.\" The University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world. The population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites. It calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site. The study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat. For example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline. \"We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals,\" Dr Higginson told BBC News. \"We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat.\" He said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food. Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said. This could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in.

The chief suspect who was jailed for murdering his wife in Latvia, Zalkalns was found hanged in west London. Alice's parents said they welcomed the coroner's decision. The full inquest, to be held in front of a jury, will start in June. Alice, 14, went missing on 28 August last year having last been seen alive on the Grand Union Canal towpath near Hanwell. Her body was found on 30 September after Scotland Yard's biggest search operation since the July 7 bombings in 2005. Builder Zalkalns, 41, is believed to have killed Alice in a sexually motivated attack and then dumped her body. He had been imprisoned in Latvia for murdering his wife but was released and travelled to the UK in 2007. His body was found in woodland in Boston Manor Park. Police said he would have been charged with Alice's murder had he lived. Alice Gross investigation - timeline. The Gross family lawyer asked at a pre-hearing in October that the inquest should cover whether there was any failure by the authorities to implement statutory safeguards to protect the public under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to life. Sitting at the High Court earlier, Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said she accepted the submissions, adding that witnesses would be called to determine \"how he (Zalkalns) came to be in the country in the first place, given his convictions for murder and firearms offences\". The inquest will also look at \"the systems that were in place at the time, and whether appropriate checks were carried out\". Katerina Laiblova, Zalkalns' girlfriend, could be called to give evidence to the inquest about his mental state prior to his death, Dr Wilcox added. In 2009 Zalkans was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a teenage girl but no charges followed. At the time of that alleged offence it appeared he was still subject to a supervisory or probationary arrangement in Latvia, that hearing was told. A statement from Alice's parents, Ros Hodgkiss and Jose Gross, said they were pleased \"at the range of information that the coroner is willing to put in front of the jury\". They also said it was their hope that the coroner \"will be able to make recommendations to prevent this kind of thing happening again\".

Its gloomier projection may be seen as a particular embarrassment for the Tories, given that unlike Labour and the Liberal Democrats they are committed to generating a surplus on the overall budget. However a small part of the forecasting difference between the IMF and the OBR is that the IMF assumes there will be a weakish minority government after the election and therefore spending will be a bit higher than the Tories' plan. So a senior Tory put a brave face on the IMF's disagreement with the OBR and said it showed the risks of voters not giving them a clear mandate. However that is not the whole story, in that the IMF also believes the OBR is being a bit too optimistic about growth and tax revenues in the latter years of the next parliament. In truth therefore the IMF is highlighting that whoever leads the next government may be forced to increase taxes or cut spending a bit more than currently planned. This may represent a bigger headache for the Tories than Labour or the LibDems given that in the last few days the Tories have committed themselves to \u00a36bn of tax cuts and \u00a38bn of increased spending on the NHS, without saying where the money for these giveaways would come from. In fact just yesterday a senior Tory pointed to the OBR's projected surplus for 2019/20 and said that would cover (almost) the NHS commitment. Well the IMF today says that \u00a37bn surplus is a chimera. All that said, the IMF forecast is a million miles from being devastating for any party: the difference between a \u00a37bn deficit and \u00a37bn surplus in 2020 is just 0.6% of GDP or national income - which is a rounding error in the context of a deficit that was a humongous 10% of GDP just five years ago.", "qas": [{"question": "The IMF has cut its forecast for which country 's budget deficit ?", "answers": [], "id": 4520}, {"question": "What did the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for the UK budget deficit ?", "answers": [], "id": 4521}, {"question": "What has the IMF cut its forecast for ?", "answers": [], "id": 4522}, {"question": "What has cut its forecast for the UK budget deficit ?", "answers": [], "id": 4523}, {"question": "The IMF has cut its forecast for the budget deficit of which country ?", "answers": [], "id": 4524}, {"question": "What has the International Monetary Fund cut what for the UK budget deficit ?", "answers": [], "id": 4525}, {"question": "What has the International Monetary Fund cut for the UK budget deficit ?", "answers": [], "id": 4526}, {"question": "The IMF cut its forecast for the budget deficit of which country ?", "answers": [], "id": 4527}, {"question": "Who has cut its forecast for the UK budget deficit ?", "answers": [], "id": 4528}, {"question": "What is the abbreviation for The International Monetary Fund ?", "answers": [], "id": 4529}]}], "title": "Its new official forecast is"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Fields around organic farms have more types of wild plants, providing benefits for wildlife, say scientists.

The new study, by researchers at the University of Swansea and institutes in France, looked at fields sowed with winter wheat in the region of Poitou-Charente. They found that organic farming led to higher weed diversity on surrounding conventionally farmed fields. \"Wild plants are important for birds, bees and other farmland species,\" said Dr Luca Borger of the department of biosciences at Swansea University. \"Organic farming has advantages in maintaining these, but even a mixture of organic and non-organic farming in an area can help maintain this biodiversity. \"Even only 25% of fields being organically farmed can make a difference.\" Farmland provides essential habitat for many animals but intensification of agriculture has led to a loss of biodiversity. However, in order to provide the extra food needed by the bigger human population of the future, without destroying forests and wetlands, farming needs to be made more intensive. Supporters of organic farming say the method could be a potential compromise between meeting food security needs and providing habitat for bees, birds and other wildlife. The researchers say land-sharing between organic farms and non-organic farms could have benefits for both crop production and biodiversity.

Warren Beatty fared worse - his first film in 15 years, the 1950s Hollywood comedy Rules Don't Apply, took just $2.2m (\u00a31.7m). The film is Beatty's first directed feature since 1998's Bulworth. Bad Santa 2, released 13 years after the original and again starring Billy Bob Thornton, did a little better, taking $9m (\u00a37.3m).

To answer that you need to separate his value to United right now from how some might view his broader value in the transfer market. For all the income they generate, United are a club going through a difficult transition. They are way off the pace in the Premier League and struggling to qualify for the Champions League next season. The financial impact of failure this season will not dent the money making machine that is Old Trafford, but long term decline? That's a very different proposition. All of this has placed huge pressure on the club's new manager David Moyes and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward to show the club is still a force to be reckoned with despite the retirement of the formidable Sir Alex Ferguson. The record signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea in the January transfer window was the first part of what Woodward and Moyes hope will be a three-step strategy back to the top. Rooney's new deal is part two while the summer is phase three. That's when we will really be able to judge how serious the club's American owners, the Glazer family, are about rebuilding United's under-powered squad. Mata's arrival and Rooney's decision to stay - having been courted first by Manchester City and more recently Chelsea - will surely help the club attract top talent before the start of next season. The other thing to consider is that Rooney had just 18 months remaining on his previous deal. United knew they faced the possibility of him leaving for nothing. By signing him up for five and-a-half years, they have protected the value of arguably their most valuable and recognisable playing asset. So while the \u00a385m agreement up to 2019 looks exorbitant, it's probably cheaper than United having to find a replacement in the transfer market and pay his wages. The total cost would have probably been much higher. It leaves United free to spend their money elsewhere - with midfield and defence arguably a greater priority. The deal Rooney has signed is, I am told, worth around \u00a3250,000 a week in basic salary. What makes the new contract potentially much more lucrative to the England striker is an agreement with the club to market and exploit his individual commercial rights around the world. This obviously has benefits for both the club and the player but there is no doubting United's hugely successful commercial operation could help take Rooney to a new financial level and certainly on a par with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. In playing terms it would be hard to argue Rooney is in the same league as those two. But as things stand he is United's most marketable brand and that is ultimately why the club couldn't afford to let him go.", "qas": [{"question": "What is a huge deal for Manchester United ?", "answers": [], "id": 4610}, {"question": "How big is Wayne Rooney 's contract with Manchester United ?", "answers": [], "id": 4611}, {"question": "Who views Wayne Rooney 's contract with Manchester United as a huge deal ?", "answers": [], "id": 4612}, {"question": "Who did Rooney 's contract with Manchester United represent a huge deal for ?", "answers": [], "id": 4613}, {"question": "How long term contract with is what kind of deal for Manchester ?", "answers": [], "id": 4614}, {"question": "Which player recently signed a new contract with Manchester United ?", "answers": [], "id": 4615}, {"question": "Who is Wayne Rooney 's contract with Manchester United a huge deal for ?", "answers": [], "id": 4616}, {"question": "Which footballer recently signed a contract with Manchester United ?", "answers": [], "id": 4617}, {"question": "Which player 's contract with Manchester United is a huge deal ?", "answers": [], "id": 4618}, {"question": "Which footballer 's contract is a huge deal for Manchester United ?", "answers": [], "id": 4619}]}], "title": "But many people will be"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The 27-year-old will not need surgery after breaking his leg in an innocuous clash with Reds winger Raheem Sterling.

The government will also produce a new air quality plan by the end of April. But Theresa May has said she will \"take into account\" drivers encouraged to buy diesel cars by previous governments. Former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax in 2001 to encourage people to buy diesel cars, as they were more economical and thought to be less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. But there has been increasing concern from experts that the vehicles emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to have caused thousands of premature deaths in the UK. The government has to produce a new air quality plan after receiving a \"final warning\" from the European Commission about breaches of legal air quality levels in the UK. It also lost two court cases in 2015 and 2016 over pollution levels brought by environmental lawyers ClientEarth. To tackle the issue, a so-called \"toxin tax\" is expected to be rolled out across several cities, charging drivers of diesel cars up to \u00c2\u00a320 per day to come into urban areas. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that such a scheme - creating an the ultra low emission zone in the capital - would come into force in two years' time, with a charge of \u00c2\u00a312.50 for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards. But motoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being \"punished\" for following a previous government's policy. Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase. Speaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: \"Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan. \"But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future. \" She did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles.", "qas": [{"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car need to pay to cover air pollution each day ?", "answers": [], "id": 4630}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car have to pay to cover air pollution each day ?", "answers": [], "id": 4631}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car need to pay to cover air pollution ?", "answers": [], "id": 4632}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car have to pay each week ?", "answers": [], "id": 4633}, {"question": "What kind of cars are to be charged extra for air pollution ?", "answers": [], "id": 4634}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car have to pay per day ?", "answers": [], "id": 4635}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car have to pay each day to cover air pollution ?", "answers": [], "id": 4636}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car have to pay for each hour of pollution ?", "answers": [], "id": 4637}, {"question": "How much money does a driver of a diesel car have to pay to cover air pollution ?", "answers": [], "id": 4638}, {"question": "What are the cars that are charged the most ?", "answers": [], "id": 4639}]}], "title": "An ultra low emission zone"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The 122-year-old Victorian structure spanning the River Thames last underwent refurbishment in 1970.

Some of the main points in the new guidance say that doctors should:. Prof Terence Stephenson, the chairman of the General Medical Council, said some patients in this area were vulnerable and needed protecting. \"We are clear that doctors must not pressure patients to make rushed decisions they may end up regretting and they must give them enough information so they can make an informed choice.\" Rajiv Grover, consultant plastic surgeon and former President of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), welcomed the GMC's guidance because he said some patients were psychologically unsuitable for cosmetic surgery. \"Cosmetic surgery has for too long been seen as a commodity but unfortunately once an operation is done - it can't be taken back to the shop.\" He said Baaps had insisted on a two-week cooling-off period for many years and also encouraged a second consultation with a surgeon before a decision was made.

Last year Rabobank paid $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3597m) to US and European regulators for its part in the global rate-rigging scandal. Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank have all previously been fined for rate rigging. Mr Robson conspired to manipulate Libor submissions to benefit trading positions between 2006 and 2011, the US Department of Justice said. Libor - London interbank offered rate - is one of the interest rates use by global banks to lend money to each other. It supports hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions, and is used to set interest rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages. Regulators in the US and Europe have been investigating whether banks attempted to manipulate this and other key interest rates to benefit their own trading positions. Nine people, including Robson, have so far been charged by the Justice Department. US prosecutors said Robson pleaded guilty to one charge out of the 15 he had faced. Takayuki Yagami, another former senior trader at Rabobank, in June became the first to plead guilty for his role in the scheme. Robson worked as a senior trader at Rabobank's money markets desk in London, and also served as the bank's primary submitter for the Yen Libor calculation, the Justice Department said. He used his position to submit rates requested by Yagami and other traders, according to prosecutors. In 2007 Yagami asked Robson by email for a high submission for one of the rates, Robson answered: \"no prob mate let me know your level.\" After Yagami made his request, according to the Justice Department, Robson confirmed: \"sure no prob... I'll probably get a few phone calls but no worries mate... there's bigger crooks in the market than us guys!\" In a statement Leslie Caldwell, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division, said: \"The scope of the fraud was massive, but the scheme was simple.

Read more on this story as it develops throughout the day on our Local Live pages. The disagreement emerged in an exchange of letters in 2014 seen by the BBC after a freedom of information request to Devon and Cornwall Police.

Andrew White, chief executive of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, said in a statement: \"The building doesn't decide if the commissioner is impartial or not. \"I think it will mean an improvement for the public because we'll be spending less money on our estate... so more money will go to policing and that's the most important thing about this change.\" Mr Hogg is expected to decide on whether to go ahead with the move later this year.

But Celtic could effectively wrap up their fifth Premiership title in a row with victory against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday, given their vastly superior goal difference to second-placed Aberdeen, who they face the following weekend. \"We need to bounce back from this now,\" said Brown, in Dublin to promote Celtic's pre-season International Champions Cup match against Barcelona on 30 July. \"We need to start getting ourselves together. We need to go back to winning ways. We've got next season to look forward to. \"We are going for five in a row now and we want to continue it, we want to get six and seven. \"We believe we've got the players in that dressing room that can do that and we've just got to put a lot of faith and trust in ourselves and express a lot more than we have been doing in recent weeks. \"As everyone knows there's going to be a new manager but we're concentrating on the last three or four games of the season. \"For now Ronny is still our manager and now we need to try and win the league for him as soon as possible and give him something back.\" Deila resigned days after the Hoops were beaten by Old Firm rivals Rangers on penalties in the Scottish Cup semi-finals. Fans were also frustrated at the club's lack of Champions League progress under the Norwegian. Former West Brom boss Steve Clarke has become the latest to declare his interest in the vacancy, although David Moyes remains the bookmakers' favourite.

Researchers analysed data from patients who were taking bisphosphonates, which are used to prevent the loss of bone material. However, scientists say further studies are still needed. When joints become damaged or worn out, commonly due to osteoarthritis, it can be painful and limits movement. An implant can dramatically improve a patient's mobility. More than 50,000 hip and 70,000 knee, replacements take place in the UK each year. While they can last for decades, some fail within years. This can happen when the bone around the implant is dissolved by the body meaning the replacement joint becomes loose. The theory was that bisphosphonates, which are used by patients with osteoporosis to prevent bone being broken down, would prevent the loosening. The researchers looked at data from General Practice Research Database for joint replacements and compared what happened to 1,912 patients taking bisphosphonates with 41,995 patients who did not. After five years, 1.96% of implants failed without the drug, compared with 0.93% in those taking medication. Prof Nigel Arden, a specialist in rheumatic diseases at the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, said the first implant would cost the NHS about \u00c2\u00a37,000, but replacements would cost \u00c2\u00a334,000. He told the BBC: \"It has the potential to have a huge impact.\" He said two of the risk factors, age and obesity, meant the number of cases was \"increasing dramatically\". Prof Arden is not arguing that people should be given the drug yet. He has applied for funding for a further trial to test the effectiveness of bisphosphonates and which patients would benefit most. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies welcomed the findings. \"With such a high incidence of knee and hip replacement surgery, the possibility that the life of joint implants could be lengthened and reduce the number of complex revision surgeries means that these results have the potential to make significant improvements to the lives of many NHS patients,\" she said.", "qas": [{"question": "What could be used to extend the life of hip or knee replacements ?", "answers": [], "id": 4890}, {"question": "What could be used to extend the life of hip and knee replacements ?", "answers": [], "id": 4891}, {"question": "What suggests that a drug could be used to extend the life of hip and knee replacements ?", "answers": [], "id": 4892}, {"question": "What could be used to extend the life of drugs ?", "answers": [], "id": 4893}, {"question": "What suggests a drug could be used to extend the life of hip and knee replacements ?", "answers": [], "id": 4894}, {"question": "What could be used to prolong the life of drugs ?", "answers": [], "id": 4895}, {"question": "What could be treated with an antibiotic to extend its life ?", "answers": [], "id": 4896}, {"question": "WhatCould a drug be used to extend the life of hip or knee replacements ?", "answers": [], "id": 4897}, {"question": "WhatDrug could be used to extend the life of what ?", "answers": [], "id": 4898}, {"question": "WhatCould a drug be used to prolong the life of a hip or knee replacement ?", "answers": [], "id": 4899}]}], "title": "The study, published on the"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Trainer John Gosden let the unbeaten 4-7 favourite race after he walked the course and she beat runner-up Vintage Folly by a length and three quarters.

In a statement Jenny Sutton, Ms Sutton's sister, said \"at this stage we believe that Jacky acted alone\". But the statement added that there remained \"the possibility that additional information will come to light\". An investigation into the death is currently being carried out by Turkish authorities. The statement said the family and the IWPR had carried out an \"extensive review\" of information provided by Turkish authorities. Jenny Sutton said: \"The family is satisfied with the investigation undertaken by the Turkish authorities. \"We were deeply sceptical about initial reports.

This all indicated that Ms Sutton had been alone and there was no evidence of a struggle, they said. The decision to release information from the investigation had followed \"widespread speculation\" about the circumstances surrounding Ms Sutton's death, the statement added.

All four refused to consent to extradition when appearing in court. The men are due to appear before magistrates again on 20 November. They were arrested on Thursday on European Arrest warrants. During their court appearance, their lawyers indicated they may challenge their extradition because of the risk of \"refoulement\", which the United Nations defines as \"the expulsion of persons who have the right to be recognised as refugees\". The men were held as part of raids in six European countries, led by Italian authorities and connected to a suspected \"jihadist network\", Rawti Shax, which is said to be seeking to establish a caliphate in Iraq's Kurdistan region. The group was allegedly plotting to free its leader, Mullah Krekar, who is in detention in Norway. Suspects were also arrested in Italy and Norway, while authorities in Italy, Germany, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the UK also searched a total of 26 properties. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said there was no suggestion any of those arrested were planning attacks in the UK. Their focus appeared to have been in the Middle East, he added, with the investigation aimed at breaking up an international recruiting pipeline that was sending jihadists to join the Islamic State and Al-Nusra organisations - both proscribed terrorist organisations - in Iraq and Syria. Eurojust, the EU agency which co-ordinated the European raids, said suspected leaders and several members of the group were arrested during simultaneous activity in the six countries. It added: \"The arrested persons are charged with international terrorism.\" The operation, which follows several years of work by investigators, was launched under the direction of the Public Prosecution Office in Rome. Mullah Krekar went to Norway as a refugee in 1991 from Iraq and founded radical Islamist group Ansar al-Islam, although he later tried to distance himself from it. Norwegian authorities have been trying to deport him since 2003 after deeming him a threat to national security. Eurojust said Rawti Shax, or Didi Nwe, meaning the \"new course\" or \"towards the mountain\", represented an \"evolution of Ansar al-Islam\", which is listed by the UN as a terrorist organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda. It says the group has a \"primary objective\" which is to \"violently overthrow the current Iraqi Kurdish government and replace it with a caliphate governed by Sharia law\". It also alleged that the group was active in providing logistical and financial support for the recruitment of foreign fighters to be sent to Syria and Iraq, and also had the intent of training them for a future conflict in Kurdistan.", "qas": [{"question": "How many many British men been charged with terrorism offences ?", "answers": [], "id": 4930}, {"question": "What did the four British men appear in ?", "answers": [], "id": 4931}, {"question": "What have the four British men been charged with ?", "answers": [], "id": 4932}, {"question": "What did the British men who were charged with terrorism offences appear in ?", "answers": [], "id": 4933}, {"question": "Who has appeared in court charged with terrorism offences ?", "answers": [], "id": 4934}, {"question": "What are the British men charged with ?", "answers": [], "id": 4935}, {"question": "What are the four British men charged with ?", "answers": [], "id": 4936}, {"question": "What are the four men charged with terrorism offences ?", "answers": [], "id": 4937}, {"question": "What nationality are the four men charged with terrorism offences ?", "answers": [], "id": 4938}, {"question": "What nationality are the four men charged with terrorism offenses ?", "answers": [], "id": 4939}]}], "title": "Bakr Hamad, 38, of Hull,"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The second instalment of the drama has already begun filming in Australia, with Elisabeth Moss reprising her role as detective Robin Griffin.

They argue that the curvy glassware makes pacing yourself a much greater challenge. A group of 159 men and women were filmed drinking either soft drinks or beer as part of the study. The glasses all contained around half a pint of liquid, but some of the glasses were straight while others were very curved. There was no difference in the drinking time for soft drinks. People drinking from both straight and curved glasses finished after around seven minutes. However, for the beer drinkers there was a large difference between the two groups. While it took around seven minutes for people drinking from a curved glass to polish off their half pint, it took 11 minutes for those drinking from a straight glass. The report said: \"Drinking time is slowed by almost 60% when an alcoholic beverage is presented in a straight glass compared with a curved glass.\" The researchers thought that curvy glasses made it harder to pace drinking because judging how much was in the glass became more difficult owing to its curved shape. The group of drinkers was shown a variety of pictures of partially-filled beer glasses and asked to say whether they were more or less than half full. The team said people were more likely to get the answer wrong when assessing the amount of liquid in curved glasses. The lead researcher Dr Angela Attwood told the BBC: \"They are unable to judge how quickly they are drinking so cannot pace themselves.\" She suggested that people were not concerned about pacing themselves with soft drinks, which could explain why glass shape had no effect on them. However, the study looked only at the time taken to finish one drink in a laboratory setting. So it is not certain what happens on an evening out if multiple drinks are consumed. She said altering the glasses used in pubs could \"nudge\" people to drink more healthily by \"giving control back\". The shape of a glass has already been shown to affect how much alcohol people pour. A study in 2005 showed people were more likely to pour extra alcohol into short, wide glasses than tall, narrow ones.", "qas": [{"question": "What is a significant influence on the time it takes to finish a half pint of beer ?", "answers": [], "id": 5020}, {"question": "What does n't seem to change the time it takes to finish a half pint of beer ?", "answers": [], "id": 5021}, {"question": "What , in relation to finishing a half pint of beer , does not have an effect on how long it takes ?", "answers": [], "id": 5022}, {"question": "What beverage does not seem to have any effect on how long it takes to finish a half pint of ?", "answers": [], "id": 5023}, {"question": "What , in general , does not have the ability to slow down consumption of a half pint of beer ?", "answers": [], "id": 5024}, {"question": "What , in general , does not seem to have an effect on how long it takes to finish a half pint of beer ?", "answers": [], "id": 5025}, {"question": "What beverage does not appear to have any effect on how long it takes to finish a half pint of ?", "answers": [], "id": 5026}, {"question": "What do soft drinks alter the time it takes to drink a half pint of beer ?", "answers": [], "id": 5027}, {"question": "What does n't seem to affect the time it takes to finish a half pint of beer ?", "answers": [], "id": 5028}, {"question": "What beverage does not seem to have an effect on how long it takes to finish a half pint of ?", "answers": [], "id": 5029}]}], "title": "However, researchers at the University"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "She died peacefully, aged 87, on Monday the 8th of April 2013. She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. When she came to power in 1979 she wanted to make big changes to how the country was run - and she transformed Britain. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She believed that private companies would run the services better. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. The PM became a hero to many when in 1982 she sent British Troops to defend the Falklands. The tiny islands eight thousand miles away in the South Atlantic sea had been invaded by Argentina. Although hundreds of lives were lost, the victory was celebrated on the streets back home. Read more: Tributes to Margaret Thatcher. But though she had many supporters, some of the changes she introduced were very unpopular and there were protests and riots on the streets. In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. Margaret Thatcher was thought to have survived on just four hours sleep a night - and got the nickname \"the Iron Lady\" for being tough and sticking to her decisions. In 2012 a big movie was made of her life, called The Iron Lady. Was Lady Thatcher an inspiration to girls? After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century. Margaret Thatcher's life in pictures. But eventually even her own party thought she had been in charge too long - and she left Downing Street in tears.

Police say the suspects are due to appear in court on Wednesday in Lahore. The victims have been identified as Shehzad Masih and his wife Shama. About 200 people in Lahore, mainly from the Christian community and human rights organisations, protested against the killings, which took place in the town of Kot Radha Kishan about 60km (40 miles) to the south-west. They held signs saying \"Christian carnage in the name of blasphemy should be stopped\" and \"the government has failed to give protection to minorities\", BBC Urdu's Shumaila Jaffrey reports from Lahore. Union leader Farooq Tariq told the BBC that the dispute was actually over money. \"The owner of the brick kiln gave it a religious colour, and they locked up the Christian woman Shama for two days, then attacked her with shovels, then tortured her husband and threw them in the brick kiln. \"It's the worst misuse of religion,\" he said. In a statement, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said \"a responsible state cannot tolerate mob rule and public lynching with impunity\". \"The Pakistani state has to act proactively to protect its minorities from violence and injustice.\" Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry a potential death sentence for anyone who insults Islam. Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been found guilty of desecrating the Koran or of blasphemy. While most of them have been sentenced to death by the lower courts, many sentences have been overturned due to lack of evidence. However, correspondents say even the mere accusation of blasphemy, or defending someone accused of blasphemy, is enough to make someone a target for hardliners. In May gunmen in the city of Multan shot dead a lawyer, Rashid Rehman, who had been defending a university lecturer accused of blasphemy.

It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true\", but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.

The coalition confirmed it had targeted \"IS command-and-control elements\" in the area on Monday, but said the raid had been \"meticulously planned\" to avoid harming civilians. There was no immediate comment from the coalition on Wednesday's reported attack. The Russian and Syrian air forces also fly sorties in the region.

DeirEzzor24 said the house of a person not connected to IS appeared to have been targeted, and that several nearby buildings had also been destroyed. Women and children were among those killed, it added, warning that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the injured. Mayadin, which lies in the Euphrates river valley about 45km (28 miles) south-east of the city of Deir al-Zour, has been targeted frequently by coalition aircraft.

During a single low tide a skilled octopus hunter can spear more than 10 of the slimy invertebrates, which thrive amid the maze of rocks, corals and sea grass that lie beyond the beaches. The catch is highly prized by the island's tourist hotels and provides an important source of protein for coastal communities. Protected by an offshore reef, the tidal flats off the island's east coast provide livelihoods and sustenance for local residents, in the form of fish, crabs, shellfish, seaweed and octopus. Tanzania is the largest producer of octopus in the western Indian Ocean. Abdullah Ali, 35, prepares to launch his traditional wooden boat on an octopus hunting expedition from Dongwe village. Traditionally a female-dominated activity, more men are now turning to octopus for a source of income. \"The octopus has helped me to drive my life forward,\" said Ali, who makes about \u00a31.90 ($2.30) per kg (2lb 3oz) for his octopuses.

Mama Juma, a seasoned octopus hunter, scans the crystal clear water near Paje beach for likely octopus hideouts. A lone woman searches for octopus in the evening beyond a seaweed farm at Bwejuu.

She was given antiretroviral drugs at birth. Despite appearing to be free of HIV for nearly two years after stopping treatment, she was found to be harbouring the virus.

They did this by feeding the reptiles small, less potent cane toads. Many that tried the toads once did not make the same mistake again. The researchers say that extending the trial could help the continent's wildlife. The study is published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters. Lead researcher Georgia Ward-Fear, from the University of Sydney, said: \"We've been very surprised by the results, by the amount of time that some of these lizards have actually retained this knowledge and survived in the presence of a high-density of cane toads, which is basically unheard of in the wild.\" Cane toads were introduced to Australia in the 1930s to control sugar cane pests. But the subsequent spread has been unstoppable, devastating the continent's animals. Among the hardest hit are the yellow-spotted monitors (Varanus panoptes). Their population is estimated to have plummeted by 90%. When the toads invade a new area, these yellow-and-black-spotted reptiles feast on the amphibians, and subsequently die. \"A goanna only has to mouth a toad for less than 30 seconds and it can kill them,\" said Dr Ward-Fear. \"This species is quite abundant in ecosystems ahead of a cane toad invasion, and then as we see the invasion move through, they are basically wiped out of the landscape.\" In the trials, the researchers tracked down wild lizards before the toads descended. Dr Ward-Fear explained: \"We presented them with a small toad via our very technical apparatus: a telescopic fishing pole. The toad had a little cotton belt attached to it. \"We sidled up to the goanna in a very stealthy manner and extended the fishing pole.\" The young toads made the lizards sick, but were not toxic enough to do lasting harm. The scientists then attached radio transmitters to follow the goannas as the amphibians arrived in the area. Many of the 16 lizards who'd already tasted toad did not make the same mistake again - and more than half survived during the 18-month study period. The team also followed 31 \"untrained\" lizards that had not eaten the toads. \"We saw the goannas that had not had a negative experience with the small toad died very quickly. They all died within three months of the natural cane toad invasion arriving at the site. At the end of the study, every untrained goanna had died.\" The scientists say the study suggests goannas have the ability to learn from experience and retain that knowledge over a long period of time.

Andrew Frangos of Cornhill Capital was approached by the three-time bankrupt Chappell to raise money secured against property to use as working capital - the money you need for day to day running of a company. Mr Frangos said that BHS was not the limit of his ambitions and that Chappell had plans to one day buy Arcadia - the parent company run by Sir Philip Green. Ultimately, Chappell didn't use Cornhill Capital and the two of them are in dispute over unpaid bills. He was joined in the commons by representatives from accountants Grant Thornton and lawyers Olswang to explain their involvement as advisers to Mr Chappell.

Meetings between Chappell and the Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension scheme, totalled less than half an hour and Grant Thornton's Mark Byers said he was denied the usual access to the pension trustees and their advisors. On the bigger picture, MPs asked what the professional advisers made of this \"punt\". Why did they believe that a retail novice with a chequered financial background could succeed in turning BHS around when a feted retail tycoon had failed? We got two interesting answers. First, a central part of the turnaround plan involved getting the landlords for the 164 stores to agree to reduce the rent. Mark Byers, from Grant Thornton said it would be difficult to have that negotiation, for BHS essentially to plead poverty, as long as BHS was part of the bigger Arcadia group. Second, it wasn't their job. So far there is no smoking gun. What is emerging from these sessions is that lots of professional firms were tasked with making sure small bits of the deal ticked a number of boxes. No one, it seems, was there to look Mr Chappell in the eye and judge whether he had the ability, or even the intention, of making BHS work.

She added: \"Aside from the fact that the Arches is one of Glasgow's most cultural venues, this is obviously a very worrying time for the staff facing redundancy. \"Can the deputy first minister assure those affected that the Scottish Government will offer all the support that it can?\" Mr Swinney replied: \"Creative Scotland is working hard with the organisation and with other partners to explore options regarding the future of arts programming of this nature in Glasgow. \"Creative Scotland agreed with Glasgow Life and Glasgow City Council to bring forward some of this year's support for the Arches - \u00a392,000 from Creative Scotland and \u00a337,000 from Glasgow City Council - to assist with the delivery of the current arts programme in the short-term. \"I reassure Sandra White that we will look in all ways that we possibly can do to assist in safeguarding the future of what I recognise as a significant cultural venue in the city of Glasgow and a venue that contributes a great deal to the cultural life of Scotland.\" Ms White said she was now calling on Glasgow City Council, Police Scotland and the management of the Arches to get round the table and \"see what can be done to either reverse the closure or see what can be done to reopen the doors as soon as possible\". The Scottish government has also said staff potentially affected the Arches going into administration would be supported through the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace) initiative. The Arches has received \u00a311.2m of public funding, including \u00a33.8m of capital funding, through Creative Scotland and previously the Scottish Arts Council over the past 20 years.", "qas": [{"question": "Who has said that they will do what they can to safeguard the future of a Glasgow arts venue ?", "answers": [], "id": 5210}, {"question": "Who has said that it will do what it can to safeguard the future of a Glasgow arts venue ?", "answers": [], "id": 5211}, {"question": "What does the government say it will do its best to safeguard ?", "answers": [], "id": 5212}, {"question": "In what city is a new venue for Scottish music located ?", "answers": [], "id": 5213}, {"question": "Who has said that they will do what they can to help Glasgow 's arts venue ?", "answers": [], "id": 5214}, {"question": "Who has pledged to do what it takes to safeguard the future of a Glasgow arts venue ?", "answers": [], "id": 5215}, {"question": "What government has said it will do what it can to help Glasgow arts venues ?", "answers": [], "id": 5216}, {"question": "What does the Scottish government say it will do its best to protect ?", "answers": [], "id": 5217}, {"question": "What does the government of Scotland wish to safeguard for the arts in Glasgow ?", "answers": [], "id": 5218}, {"question": "In what city is a Scottish government official said he will do his best to protect a local arts venue ?", "answers": [], "id": 5219}]}], "title": "The Arches announced on Wednesday"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The St Athan Search and Rescue Helicopter Service was officially launched on Thursday. From its \u00a37m Vale of Glamorgan base, it will conduct land and sea missions previously carried out by the RAF. It started operating on 4 October and has so far completed eight missions. The new base is one of 10 being set up around the UK by 2017, with 22 helicopters set to conduct land and sea searches on behalf of HM Coastguard. A ten-year contract was awarded by the Department for Transport to Bristow Helicopters to deliver the service. Two of the new bases are in Wales, with one in Caernarfon, Gwynedd replacing RAF Valley and St Athan covering an area once served by helicopters from RAF Chivenor in Devon. There are two Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters based at St Athan, each worth around \u00a37.5m and fitted with night vision and state-of-the art medical equipment. \"We aim to be ready to fly within 15 minutes of the call in the day and 45 minutes at night. But for the last emergency we were airborne in seven minutes,\" said Capt Olly Padbury. \"We also had a call within 45 minutes of going live on 4 October, so it shows the importance of the service.\" The 30-person team will be on 24-hour call and cover an area that runs roughly between mid Wales, Bude in Cornwall, Oxford and London. Capt Padbury said the base's location meant the two helicopters could get quickly to areas that receive large amounts of emergency calls- such as Worm's Head on Gower, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Woolacombe Beach in Devon. Moving at speeds of roughly 160mph, the crew travelled to Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, in seven minutes to answer a call of a man stuck in mud recently. Other call-outs have been to a horse rider who fell in west Wales and someone who had fallen at Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. Another recent mission was to aid the Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team, who made an emergency call after a walker fell near Ystradfellte, Powys and had a pelvis injury. Richard Parkes, the director of maritime operations at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, called the base launch a \"bittersweet\" moment. He praised the previous rescue work conducted from Chivenor, saying: \"A high benchmark has been set by the RAF through 70 years of search and rescue. \"The challenge is to emulate it.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What has begun operating in south Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 5220}, {"question": "What has started operating in south Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 5221}, {"question": "What is a service that has started in south Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 5222}, {"question": "Where has the new service started ?", "answers": [], "id": 5223}, {"question": "Where has the new service started operating ?", "answers": [], "id": 5224}, {"question": "Where has the new helicopter service started operating ?", "answers": [], "id": 5225}, {"question": "Where has the service started in Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 5226}, {"question": "Where has the service started ?", "answers": [], "id": 5227}, {"question": "Where has the new helicopter service begun ?", "answers": [], "id": 5228}, {"question": "Where has the service started operating ?", "answers": [], "id": 5229}]}], "title": "The St Athan Search and"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Christopher Nolan won best director, and also received the film magazine's \"inspiration\" award.

Concern has been rising since mid-2014 about Australians going to the Middle East to fight for IS. The government will soon introduce legislation allowing it to strip dual citizens fighting in Iraq or Syria of their Australian citizenship.

One other was stopped by customs officers in Australia while two remain unaccounted for. The young women are all from Melbourne's northern and south-eastern suburbs. Assistant Commissioner Tracy Linford said two forensic psychologists had been embedded in the task force to help investigators understand why the young women were trying to join IS. \"The use of psychologists provides us with a far more comprehensive risk assessment and also assists in identifying early intervention opportunities,\" she said. \"This gives us the chance to focus on identifying those youths most at risk of radicalisation and to engage with them or their families directly.\" Local media reported that one of the women was 21-year-old Zehra Duman, who allegedly travelled overseas in December to join Mahmoud Abullatif, a Melbourne man believed to be a Islamic extremist. She travelled to Syria without her parent's knowledge, The Age newspaper reported. It is believed Abullatif was killed while fighting with IS in January but Ms Duman has yet to return home. Police said the young women were being sold a romantic view of life with IS, and had lied to their families about their travel plans. Authorities were warning parents and friends of young women about the lure of IS, saying the women could end up in arranged marriages, or forced into sexual servitude in the Middle East. \"Our intelligence tells us these women are going over there to meet their partners, to marry somebody in an arranged marriage or be pushed into sexual servitude,\" Assistant Commissioner Linford told reporters.

While admitting it was at fault, the trust had disputed the value of the claim for damages. It has been providing financial assistance to the family since 2012.

The deeply revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on 13 October, plunging Thailand into mourning. The prince was widely expected to succeed his father, but officials had earlier said he wanted to postpone it by at least a year. The official reason given was that he wanted to give the Thai people time to mourn his father before he became king. Correspondents say Thailand was left in an odd constitutional limbo as the prince, the undisputed heir, should have succeeded his father immediately. In the past doubts have been expressed by senior officials over how the crown prince can perform the role played by his father for 70 years. The monarchy occupies a pivotal place in Thailand's political order. King Bhumibol Adulyadej had been seen as a unifying figure amid periods of political unrest, including during the most recent military coup in 2014. The leader of Thailand's parliament, the National Legislative Assembly, is expected to meet the crown prince in the next few days to formally invite him. Once the crown prince accepts, his succession would then be announced to the public. But it is still not clear when that will happen. Former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda is currently standing in as regent. Thailand has rarely had what might be called routine royal successions. The last was 70 years ago, when the young King Ananda was found shot dead in his bedroom in still unexplained circumstances. When he died, an emergency session of parliament that night named his grief-stricken brother Bhumibol king. Despite private speculation over the prospects of his popular sister Princess Sirindhorn, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has been the undisputed heir to the throne since his formal investiture in 1972. Thai succession law follows the principle of primogeniture, where the throne should pass to the eldest son of the reigning king, but it also gives the king the discretion to name his own choice. King Bhumibol never wavered in his endorsement of the crown prince. But the crown prince's unexpected decision to delay taking the throne has made this yet another succession which has departed from the script.

It's a large piece of land, and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The assault began with overnight air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter.

Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told AP, without specifying their nationality. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul.

The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. \"Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,\" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are \"pervasive\" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. \"We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,\" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes.

Hausa films are popular in the mostly Muslim northern Nigeria where it is taboo for men and women to hold hands in public. The industry, commonly known as Kannywood, has been under fire from conservative Muslim clerics who accuse it of corrupting people's values. The Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria banned the actress from Kannywood films, saying that her appearance in the video violated the industry's code of ethics. It added that it hoped the ban would serve as a deterrent to other actors and actresses who are \"expected to be good ambassadors of the society they represent\". As the film opens parents are seen discussing who their successful city-dwelling son should marry. They decide on a cousin who they deem meets all their expectations of a good wife. But there's a hitch, their urban, and urbane, son is in love with an educated city lady. He wants to marry her. The family confronts their son with their choice of wife for him. The dispute generates tension and finally the parents force their son to marry the cousin. He goes through with the wedding but stays in touch with his preferred partner. They go on romantic outings during which he mentions his loveless marriage. Throughout the film, dancing and singing punctuate the action. Despite the passionate plot, there will not be any physical contact. That means no hugging and definitely no kissing. If there is to be any suggestion of sex, the screen will go dark. Ms Sadau said she took full responsibility for what happened, but argued that she was behaving professionally and added that in her line of work \"innocuous touching with other people... is inevitable\". But she reassured people that she would behave with decorum, adding: \"I have lines that I would never cross.\" Responding to the criticism she has received she said people should \"be more tolerant and forgiving towards one another and to cease all the senseless abuse, name calling and backbiting\".

He was butchered by you.\" After both men were jailed, Det Insp David Moran, who led the investigation, said: \"The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark caused the death of Jason Bryden. \"To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.\" The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs. The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks. The sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man. Neighbours said they could see the Clarks attacking Mr Bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming. Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the trial: \"This was a sustained, frenzied attack on this man.\" Afterwards, the scene of the killing was described as a \"bloodbath\". In addition to the stab wounds, Mr Bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault. He died in Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital three days later. Both brothers denied the killing. In evidence, James Clark, who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder, said: \"I didn't mean it. It was an accident.\" John Clark, who has 23 previous convictions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by Mr Bryden.", "qas": [{"question": "How many people were jailed for the samurai sword murder ?", "answers": [], "id": 5530}, {"question": "What did the brothers hide the murder ?", "answers": [], "id": 5531}, {"question": "How many people were jailed in the samurai sword murder ?", "answers": [], "id": 5532}, {"question": "Who were jailed for the murder of the samurai ?", "answers": [], "id": 5533}, {"question": "How many people were jailed for the murder of the samurai ?", "answers": [], "id": 5534}, {"question": "Who was jailed for the murder of the samurai ?", "answers": [], "id": 5535}, {"question": "Who were jailed for the killing of the samurai ?", "answers": [], "id": 5536}, {"question": "What did the brothers not do ?", "answers": [], "id": 5537}, {"question": "What kind of murder did the two brothers commit ?", "answers": [], "id": 5538}, {"question": "What did the brothers commit a murder with ?", "answers": [], "id": 5539}]}], "title": "The victim, Jason Bryden, 38,"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The English 16-time world champion beat the Belgian 4-2 at Alexandra Palace. Taylor will meet five-time world champion Van Barneveld for the fourth time at the tournament. Dutch top seed Michael van Gerwen beat England's Darren Webster 4-1 while Scottish third seed Peter Wright beat England's Ian White by the same score. Taylor battled back from behind in each of the opening three sets to lead 3-0, only to see 13th seed Huybrechts narrow the gap to 3-2. But the fourth seed survived the spirited comeback, sealing victory at the second opportunity in the sixth set to tee up the meeting with long-time rival Van Barneveld on Friday. Taylor has won two of their three previous encounters at the event, with Van Barneveld prevailing 7-6 in an epic 2007 final. Fellow Dutchman Van Gerwen was pushed by Webster - who was the lowest-ranked player left in the competition - in the first two sets, then took the third without dropping a leg. Webster, 46 from Norwich, arguably raised the biggest cheer of the night when he held off the Dutchman to win the fourth set. Both players came close to nine-dart checkouts in the fifth set, with Van Gerwen punishing his opponent's inability to complete the feat by sealing victory with his next throw. In Thursday's afternoon session, sixth seed James Wade twice fought back from two-set deficits to beat fellow Englishman Michael Smith 4-3. Smith raced into a 2-0 advantage and then led 3-1 before Wade clinched victory by winning seven straight legs.

It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against \"bullying and harassment\". Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like \"burn the witch\". On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with \"vitriolic abuse\". But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. \"Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,\" they wrote. \"The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. \"Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission.\" They claimed Labour \"fought a positive, hopeful campaign\" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was \"surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that\". Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on \"the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections\". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being \"driven away from politics at a time when we need them\" he said. \"This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,\" he said, claiming there had been a \"deafening silence\" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a \"significant part\" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as \"baseless\". \"If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution,\" a spokesman for the group said.", "qas": [{"question": "Who has Labour accused of promoting personal attacks on social media ?", "answers": [], "id": 5550}, {"question": "Where has Labour accused the Conservative Party of promoting personal attacks ?", "answers": [], "id": 5551}, {"question": "What does Labour accuse the Conservative Party of promoting ?", "answers": [], "id": 5552}, {"question": "Which party has been accused of promoting personal attacks on social media ?", "answers": [], "id": 5553}, {"question": "What has Labour accused the Conservative Party of promoting ?", "answers": [], "id": 5554}, {"question": "What has Labour accused the Conservatives of promoting ?", "answers": [], "id": 5555}, {"question": "What party accuses the Conservative party of promoting personal attacks ?", "answers": [], "id": 5556}, {"question": "Where has Labour accused the Conservative Party of promoting attacks ?", "answers": [], "id": 5557}, {"question": "What has Labour accused the Tories of promoting ?", "answers": [], "id": 5558}, {"question": "Where is the Conservative party accused of being ?", "answers": [], "id": 5559}]}], "title": "Ahead of a Westminster debate"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Glamis Hall hosted a lunch club, including a three-course meal and activities, at its Wellingborough home.

Dr Fiona Mathews, senior lecturer in mammalian biology and chair of the Mammal Society, said: \"We have very poor information on rabbits and hares - and it's important to know if numbers are going up or down. \"They are part of the ecosystem and lots of other animals depend on them, either through grazing of their habitat or as a food source for foxes or birds of prey.\" She said some parts of the UK had very low populations of rabbits and hares, particularly where there had been disease outbreaks. However, in other regions they have become so abundant they have become agricultural pests. The Mammal society wants people across the country to send in sightings of wild rabbits or hares across the countryside, including parks, fields and mountains. The data will be used in a national atlas of mammals to support future conservation and research projects. Derek Crawley, who is co-ordinating the atlas, said rabbits and hares can be distinguished by their gait and appearance. \"Hares are larger, have long limbs and lollop along whereas the rabbit has a bobbing gait,\" he said. \"The ears are also distinctive: those of hares are longer and have black tips.\" Sightings of rabbits and hares, or their signs in the countryside, such as droppings and burrows, with any photographs taken, can be reported via the Mammal Tracker app, The Mammal Society website, or by posting information to The Mammal Society.", "qas": [{"question": "Who is tracking the population of rabbits in the UK ?", "answers": [], "id": 5570}, {"question": "Who is being asked to report sightings of wild rabbits ?", "answers": [], "id": 5571}, {"question": "What country are people asked to report sightings of wild rabbits ?", "answers": [], "id": 5572}, {"question": "What are people asked to report in regards to rabbits ?", "answers": [], "id": 5573}, {"question": "What country are people being asked to report sightings of wild rabbits ?", "answers": [], "id": 5574}, {"question": "What are people asked to report sightings of wild rabbits and hares ?", "answers": [], "id": 5575}, {"question": "What kind of survey is the government part of ?", "answers": [], "id": 5576}, {"question": "Along with hares , what animal were people asked to report sightings of ?", "answers": [], "id": 5577}, {"question": "What are people asked to report sightings of in the UK ?", "answers": [], "id": 5578}, {"question": "Along with hares , what animal was featured in the survey ?", "answers": [], "id": 5579}]}], "title": "The animals are easier to"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The female has taken up residence at the Loch of the Lowes centre near Dunkeld, which was home to Lady, thought to be the world's oldest breeding raptor, for 24 years.

Philanthropist and former businessman Andrej Kiska (pictured right) was elected president in 2014. He won a run-off election against the country's social democratic prime minister, Robert Fico, whose defeat was considered highly significant: if he had become head of state, his party would have controlled the presidency as well as the government. Mr Kiska campaigned on the need to have a healthy balance of power between the president and the cabinet, and called for a strengthening of the independence of the judiciary where the president appoints important personnel. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but the president has the power to pick the prime minister, appoint Constitutional Court judges and veto laws. A parliamentary majority can override vetoes.

A left-wing deputy in the Slovak parliament since 1992, and a former member of the Communist party, he had previously served as deputy chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL). He left the SDL in 1999 to establish Direction (Smer), which later merged with other parties to become Smer-Social Democracy. He first became prime minister in July 2006 and held the post until July 2010. Although Smer-SD won the most seats in the June 2010 election, he was unable to form a government and went into opposition. Smer-SD won a landslide victory in the March 2012 election, becoming the first party since independence to win an outright majority in parliament.

But according to Mr Packham, turtle doves were vulnerable, with their numbers down by 95% in the UK. Malta is the only EU country to have a recreational spring hunting season allowing birds to be shot. Mr Packham, a presenter of TV documentaries on wildlife, said Maltese hunters were ignoring restrictions under the exemption, or \"derogation\" in EU jargon. He said they were killing many other birds which are supposed to be protected. He is in Malta with the conservation group Birdlife Malta to draw attention to the annual spring shoot, which has been criticised by environmentalists for years. \"Yesterday I'm afraid to say I had a dead swift in my hand that had been illegally shot and also a dead little bittern,\" Mr Packham told Today.

Polls closed at 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT). Voter turnout had reached 36.8% after four and a half hours of voting, Tunisia's election authority said. Shortly after polls closed, Mr Essebsi's office said that there were \"indications\" that he had won. However, a spokesman for Mr Marzouki said the claims were \"without foundation\". Mr Essebsi, who turned 88 this week, held office under both deposed President Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali and Tunisia's first post-independence leader, Habib Bourguiba.

After casting his ballot, Mr Marzouki said Tusinians \"should be proud\" of themselves \"because the interim period has come to a peaceful end\".

Eventually, they believe using AI could revolutionise healthcare by turning anyone's smartphone into a cancer scanner. Cancer Research UK said it could become a useful tool for doctors. The AI was repurposed from software developed by Google that had learned to spot the difference between images of cats and dogs. It was shown 129,450 photographs and told what type of skin condition it was looking at in each one. It then learned to spot the hallmarks of the most common type of skin cancer: carcinoma, and the most deadly: melanoma. Only one in 20 skin cancers are melanoma, yet the tumour accounts for three-quarters of skin cancer deaths. The experiment, detailed in the journal Nature, then tested the AI against 21 trained skin cancer doctors. One of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: \"We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists.\" However, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy.

But how Earth acquired its \"volatile elements\" - which have low boiling points - such as carbon and sulphur remains a subject of some debate. A team now argues that a collision between Earth and an embryonic planet like Mercury could provide the answer. Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Geoscience. \"The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,\" said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas. According to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming. \"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet.\" The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon. But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from? The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets. The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history. \"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta.", "qas": [{"question": "What happened to the Earth when it became rich in carbon ?", "answers": [], "id": 5830}, {"question": "A collision between Earth and another planet early in what could explain how it became rich in carbon ?", "answers": [], "id": 5831}, {"question": "A collision between Earth and what is possible to explain how it became rich in carbon ?", "answers": [], "id": 5832}, {"question": "A collision between Earth and another planet could explain how the planet became rich in what ?", "answers": [], "id": 5833}, {"question": "What event could explain how the Earth became rich in carbon ?", "answers": [], "id": 5834}, {"question": "A collision between what body of land could explain how it became rich in carbon ?", "answers": [], "id": 5835}, {"question": "A collision between Earth and another planet early in its history could explain how what happened ?", "answers": [], "id": 5836}, {"question": "What event happened to the Earth when it became rich in carbon ?", "answers": [], "id": 5837}, {"question": "What did a collision between Earth and another planet produce ?", "answers": [], "id": 5838}, {"question": "A collision between the Earth and another planet early in its history could explain how what ?", "answers": [], "id": 5839}]}], "title": "Carbon is the key ingredient"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Pakistan's 42-year-old Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq and 40-year-old batsman Younis Khan complete the list.

The US high court previously declined to intervene in cases that had made it to the appeals court level, effectively allowing marriages to go forward. During two-and-a-half hours of arguments, the justices will consider two related questions - whether the US constitution requires states to issue marriage licences to gay and lesbian couples and whether states must recognise such marriages performed in other states.

So why is it holding elections? And how reliable are they? Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people. The number of seats is determined by each district's population. In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 \"officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals\" were elected. The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party. Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box. Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason. In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas. Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census. \"The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it\", one North Korean defector told the NK News website. \"It is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed.\" If the state works out you did not vote, NK News says, \"you and your family are in trouble\". Sunday's elections do not decide the leadership of the country. Parliamentary elections are also held in North Korea, and they decide who rules the country - which is always a foregone conclusion.

Sterling has fallen by 17% against the dollar since the UK voted to quit the European Union last June, increasing import costs and pushing up shop prices. In its latest forecast, the EY Item Club said it expected inflation to rise to 3.1% by the final quarter of 2017 before easing back to 2% by the end of 2018. On top of this, it said unemployment was likely to climb from 4.8% in the final quarter of last year to more than 6% by the end of 2018. \"[These factors are] expected to have a knock-on impact on consumer spending, as growth in disposable incomes is eroded,\" the think tank said. But the agency also said that a \"weaker pound and a softer domestic market\" were likely to encourage higher levels of UK exports, as businesses seek income opportunities overseas. It expects exports to increase by 3.3% this year and 5.2% in 2018. Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said that the fall in sterling after the Brexit vote signalled \"a permanent shift\" in the fundamental value of the currency. \"We know that it will crush consumer spending, we'll see a progressive slowdown in retail sales and indicators like that this year,\" he told the BBC. However, he also said it would offer a \"permanent incentive to investors to go out, win new customers [overseas], and build capacity and expertise\". \"The hard bit comes from getting exports up to pick up the slack left by the fall in consumer spending,\" he said. He said that a weak pound should boost experts in the near term, but that \"trade and growth in 2019 and beyond\" would largely be determined by the terms of Britain's exit deal with the EU. If exports did not pick up, the UK could be \"stuck in a slow growth economy\", he added. Financial services. It comes as a PwC survey found optimism among Britain's financial services firms fell for a fourth consecutive quarter in December. The consultancy, which surveyed 103 financial services firms on behalf of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), found 2016 to be the \"gloomiest\" year for the sector since 2008. Banks were especially pessimistic, with 90% saying that preparing for the impact of Brexit was their biggest challenge. Many have signalled they are working on plans to deal with a so-called \"hard\" exit from the EU, after Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain will leave the single market.

He added: \"What has happened is that we have had a charismatic leader for many years, who has kept a lid on things. \"Now what you have got is you've got to choose a new leader. In that, you've lifted the lid off things a bit and it bubbles over.\" Mr Coburn, who is UKIP's only elected representative in Scotland, insisted there was still a reason for the party to exist despite achieving its core aim of having the UK leave the EU. He said he wanted to ensure the country was run \"in the interests of the people not in the interests of big business or trade unions\" and that he had joined UKIP because he wanted \"radical change\" to the way the country was governed, not just because he wanted to leave the EU. And he said he would \"certainly not\" be supporting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to keep Scotland in the EU single market after Brexit. Mr Coburn insisted: \"We decided during the Scottish referendum on independence that we are part of the United Kingdom and in terms of that we voted in the European referendum, that was as a United Kingdom. \"We entered as a United Kingdom, we leave as a United Kingdom. We voted as a United Kingdom, everybody knew that beforehand.\" Nominations to replace Ms James as UKIP leader close on 31 October, with the new leader announced on 28 November.", "qas": [{"question": "What is David Coburn MEP of ?", "answers": [], "id": 6070}, {"question": "What political party is David Coburn MEP for ?", "answers": [], "id": 6071}, {"question": "What would David Coburn do his best to lead if asked ?", "answers": [], "id": 6072}, {"question": "What would David Coburn like to lead if asked ?", "answers": [], "id": 6073}, {"question": "Who would `` do his best '' to lead the party if asked ?", "answers": [], "id": 6074}, {"question": "What would David Coburn do his best to lead if asked to lead ?", "answers": [], "id": 6075}, {"question": "Who is a member of the Scottish UKIP MEP ?", "answers": [], "id": 6076}, {"question": "Who has said he would be happy to lead the party if asked ?", "answers": [], "id": 6077}, {"question": "Who would Coburn try to lead the party if asked to lead him ?", "answers": [], "id": 6078}, {"question": "What country is David Coburn from ?", "answers": [], "id": 6079}]}], "title": "UKIP is looking for a"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Media playback is not supported on this device.

Muller said the deal would lead to lower costs and larger exports of dairy products made in the UK.

The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments.

Only 144,000 of the requests for help resulted in long-term care, which includes places in care homes or help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing.

The lorry has been removed from the building and has been taken away to undergo further tests that will help establish the cause of the crash. North Ayrshire Council said it was working with contractors and engineers to ensure that the properties affected \"are made safe\". \"Engineers and contractors have started work to secure the affected buildings and it is expected that a partial demolition may be required to ensure the site is made safe,\" the council said in a statement. \"The council has agreed that contractors can work into and through the night, if necessary. \"It is hoped that this will allow the A78 to re-open early next week.\" The council said it had arranged for letters to be delivered to all 600 households in Fairlie informing them of the situation and making them aware that some noise disturbance is likely through the night while work is ongoing. The statement added: \"The council has apologised in advance for any disturbance which may be caused.\" Fairlie Community Council has been campaigning for road improvements in the area. It has argued that the route is not suitable for traffic that includes lorries heading to Hunterston power station. Councillor John Ferguson, North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for infrastructure, said: \"While responsibility for management of the A78 trunk road lies with Transport Scotland, the council has lobbied - and will continue to lobby - for improvements to the road. \"A draft version of the North Ayrshire Local Plan, published in 2003, called on the (then) Scottish Executive to 'fully assess the need for further improvements on the trunk road network and bring forward schemes at the earliest possible date for the A78 coastal route'. \"While the specific reference to a Fairlie by-pass was removed at the request of the Scottish Executive's reporter, the council's aspiration for improvement schemes along the A78 coastal route remains.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Who was killed when a lorry crashed into their home ?", "answers": [], "id": 6500}, {"question": "Where did a lorry crash into ?", "answers": [], "id": 6501}, {"question": "What did the lorry crash into ?", "answers": [], "id": 6502}, {"question": "What type of vehicle killed a woman ?", "answers": [], "id": 6503}, {"question": "What did a lorry crash into ?", "answers": [], "id": 6504}, {"question": "What has been named about the woman killed in the crash ?", "answers": [], "id": 6505}, {"question": "Who was killed when the lorry crashed into their home ?", "answers": [], "id": 6506}, {"question": "Where did a lorry crash into a house ?", "answers": [], "id": 6507}, {"question": "What has been done to honor the memory of the woman killed ?", "answers": [], "id": 6508}, {"question": "What has been named about the woman killed in the incident ?", "answers": [], "id": 6509}]}], "title": "Investigations are continuing into why"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Officials say the photo of Ms Badu in The Star newspaper was \"an insult to Islam\".

Tattoos are forbidden in Islam and using the word \"Allah\" in a way deemed disrespectful offends many Muslims. The photo of Ms Badu with several words in Arabic and Hebrew written on her body features prominently on her official fan site. It is not clear whether Ms Badu's body art is permanent. The Culture, Arts and Heritage Ministry says it was not aware of the tattoos when it initially approved the concert, the BBC's Jennifer Pak in Kuala Lumpur reports. Some Muslims began protesting after The Star published the photo. Now the culture ministry says it is justified in banning Ms Badu's concert because it breaches religious sensitivities and cultural values. Information Minister Rais Yatim said a government committee had decided to cancel the show because Ms Badu's body art was \"an insult to Islam and a very serious offence\". According to the statement, the body art \"triggered public criticism that could jeopardise national security and cause a negative impact to the government's image\". Concert organisers are in touch with officials and hope the cancellation will be reversed, the Associated Press news agency reports. Ms Badu, 41, had already arrived in Malaysia. She is \"worried and dismayed\" over the incident, according to the concert organiser. The Home Ministry has asked The Star to explain why it published the photo.

On the Derby to Birmingham lines for example, the document says 32 weekends will be hit between 2017 and 2022, 13 of them for just a day and 19 for the entire weekend. The CrossCountry rail firm and freight services would both be affected.

Rivers in Cumbria have been drying up, and the levels of water stored in reservoirs in Cornwall are getting very low. At the moment, though, the UK isn't thought to be having a drought. In April the weather was especially dry - the country saw less than half the amount of rain it normally would. Some farmers, especially those in the south and east of the UK, said there was only 10% of the rainfall they expected to see in March and April. But if normal levels of rain fall during May and June, they say it will put many crops back on track, although some crops like spring barley probably won't recover completely. Last month the driest area across the UK was Edinburgh, in Scotland. It saw 7% of its average rainfall. Southern counties in England, including Kent and Sussex, were also quite dry. They had around 20% of the rain normally expected for April. It looks like things might be looking up for the farmers soon, with some wetter weather expected this weekend. To make things confusing, there are several different types of drought. One type of drought depends on how long it's been without rain, and if there is below the average rainfall for that season. Another type looks at the reduced flow of water in rivers. But if you are a farmer, then your main worry is something called an agricultural drought - when there isn't enough water around to be able to water fruit and vegetable crops. The Environment Agency manages the levels of water stored in UK reservoirs. They are asking everyone to use water wisely - for example, turning off the taps when you're brushing your teeth.

Tamboran Resources wanted to drill a 750m deep hole at a quarry at Belcoo, using permitted development rights. It issued a statement saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the minister's decision. By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor. Tamboran had intended to drill using \"permitted development rights\", which meant the firm would not have needed to apply for planning permission. The minister could only veto this if he assessed that work was likely to have \"a significant environmental impact\". And that is exactly the position he has arrived at. Tamboran will now have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement, a process that will, conservatively, take months to complete. But it does not mean the borehole will not eventually be drilled. Alternatively, Tamboran may want to try to get a judicial review of the decision, arguing that the minister has not interpreted the planning regulations correctly. \"The company is currently reviewing its position and will release a further statement in due course,\" Tamboran said. Tamboran will now have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement. On Monday night, protesters held an ecumenical service at the gates of the quarry to celebrate the minister's decision. Donal O'Cofaigh from Belcoo Frack Free welcomed the decision and said it could delay the project considerably. \"It's a great relief, the minister has made the right decision,\" he told the BBC. \"This is the first time that we are going to have the opportunity to be consulted on that.

Tamboran staff moved into the quarry three weeks ago and carried out work to secure the site. Protesters objecting to both fracking and gas exploration had held a permanent vigil at the quarry. The aim of the borehole was to check if there was enough gas below ground to warrant seeking a licence to set up a fracking operation. Protesters said they feared a borehole could be the first step towards the setting up of an industry that they believe could damage the environment and the health of local residents. The borehole drilling process would not have involved fracking. Currently, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, the SDLP and UUP say they oppose fracking, while the DUP has said exploration should take place, and any application for extraction should be judged at the time.

The eldest son of the late presenter and broadcaster died last year, aged 31, when he was out jogging near his family's home in Oxfordshire.

It has already been rolled out at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust in London , with around 40 patients per month being successfully tested.

Indonesia is a majority Muslim country and has among the highest number of child brides in the world. According to the UN's children office Unicef, one in four women in Indonesia marries before the age of 18. Fatwas are issued regularly in Indonesia, but usually by the Indonesian Ulema Council - the highest Islamic authority in the country which is made up almost entirely of men. Hundreds of women descended on Cirebon, on Java Island, for the Indonesian KUPI Women's Ulema Congress. Most of the clerics - experts in Islamic sacred law and theology - were from Indonesia, but speakers travelled from as far away as Kenya, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to take part in the conference, said to be the first major gathering of female Muslim clerics. Female clerics, or \"ulema\", have existed in Indonesia for hundreds of years, but their role has been played down previously. Nowadays, they help empower their communities and lead educational institutes, organisers say. It is hoped the congress will highlight the vital role they play. Steering committee chairman Badriyah Fayumi told the BBC: \"Through this conference, we want to state that female clerics exist, and have been proven to contribute, and this is the time to acknowledge their existence, and to give an appreciation for the... contribution of the female clergy.\" The committee will now present its recommendations to the relevant groups - including the government - which will then decide on whether or not to take them any further. The fatwa called underage marriage \"harmful\" and said preventing it was mandatory. \"Female clerics know the issues and obstacles women face, we can take action and do not just wait for the government to protect these children,\" Ninik Rahayu, the conference organiser, told Reuters. The female clerics cited studies which highlight that many Indonesian child brides are not allowed to continue their education and half the marriages end in divorce.

The prosecutor's office said in a statement that a military vehicle was used by Gen Nshimirimana's attackers and it was subsequently burned. \"The identities of the perpetrators are now known. A certain number have been arrested. The rest of them and the masterminds are being sought,\" it said. The attackers targeted the general's car with machine guns and rocket launchers in the Kamenge district of Bujumbura. He was widely seen as the most powerful person in Burundi after Mr Nkurunziza. Meanwhile, Mr Mbonimpa's daughter said the authorities had allowed him to leave for Belgium, the former colonial power. \"He will be treated there and they can do all the tests that we can't do here. We are also more reassured about his safety there,\" Amandine Nasagarare said, AFP reports. The government condemned his shooting by a gunman on a motorbike last week as an act of \"terrorism\". Mr Mbonimpa was a staunch critic of Mr Nkurunziza's bid to run for office again, and was said to be one of the few members of Burundi's civil society who had not fled the country. In April, he was held without charge for more than 24 hours by the intelligence services after he called for protests against the president's efforts to secure a third term.", "qas": [{"question": "How many people have been arrested in connection with the killing of a Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6820}, {"question": "What happened to the Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6821}, {"question": "HowMany people have been arrested in connection with the killing of a Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6822}, {"question": "Who has been arrested in connection with the killing of the Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6823}, {"question": "How many people have been arrested in connection with the killing of a Burundi general last week ?", "answers": [], "id": 6824}, {"question": "How many people have been arrested in connection with the killing of the Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6825}, {"question": "How many people have been arrested in connection with the killing of a Burundi general?", "answers": [], "id": 6826}, {"question": "Who has been arrested in connection with the killing of a Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6827}, {"question": "What country 's general was killed last week ?", "answers": [], "id": 6828}, {"question": "Who is responsible for the killing of a Burundi general ?", "answers": [], "id": 6829}]}], "title": "However, it said the \"masterminds\""}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Video footage showed the singer striking a photographer with his car after he left a service at The City Church in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

With a reported production budget of \u00c2\u00a317m, Guardians of the Galaxy forms part of Marvel's so-called \"Phase 2\" project. The first phase involved the development and release of superhero movies featuring well-known comic book characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. Guardians' cast includes Chris Pratt, who provided the voice for Emmet Brickowoski in box office hit The Lego Movie, and Zoe Saldana, who starred in Avatar and the two recent Star Trek movies. Directed by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy draws on characters and stories that first appeared in Marvel comics in 1969. Gillan's character Nebula first appeared in the comics in 1985. Last July, Gillan unveiled part of her look for the film at Comic-Con International in San Diego, one of the world's biggest celebrations of comic books and movies based on them. During a press conference with other cast members, she removed a wig to reveal a shaven head. At the UK premiere for Guardians of the Galaxy earlier this week, Gillan told the BBC how designers working on the new Star Wars film made the wig she wore at Comic-Con. Gillan's character, Nebula, has been described in the Marvel comics as a ruthless space pirate and former leader of a band of mercenaries. There are glimpses of Gillan in trailers being seen in cinemas and online ahead of the movie's release. The actress also features on the cover of a special edition of the August issue of UK film magazine, Empire. On the cover with her are Djimon Hounsou, who plays Korath the Pursuer and previously starred with Russell Crowe in Gladiator, and Hobbit films actor Lee Pace who plays the film's chief bad guy Ronan the Accuser. After Guardians of the Galaxy, Gillan is set to star in the Western, In a Valley of Violence. The film's cast also includes Grease and Pulp Fiction actor John Travolta, Training Day's Ethan Hawke and American Horror Story's Taissa Farmiga. Gillan, who as a youngster performed at Inverness' Eden Court Theatre, will also appear on US television this autumn. She has been cast as the lead in new ABC series, Selfie. The Scot plays Eliza Dooley who has 263,000 social media followers who hang on to her every post, tweet and selfie.

A week earlier, she was restrained by police and ambulance staff in a case of post-partum psychosis, a month after giving birth to her first child. The coroner ruled the use of restraint was not a factor in the death. Her widower, Anthony Gibson-Watt, thanked the coroner for investigating the circumstances leading to the death of his wife. \"It will never bring Alice back, but it has given us a better understanding of how she came to die and in time may help us to move forward,\" he said. The inquest heard that she was admitted to A&E at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital following the psychotic episode and then taken to the Lakeside Mental Health Unit in West Middlesex Hospital. At around 03:00 GMT on 16 November Mrs Gibson-Watt, a jewellery specialist for Sotheby's, had a cardiac arrest. A nurse checked and found no pulse, the inquest heard. Her heart was recorded as restarted at 03:48, after emergency paramedics had used a defibrillator. She was moved to a life support machine at King's College Hospital in London, but died on 20 November after a brain scan pronounced her \"life extinct\". Doctors giving evidence at the inquest said that if there had been a proper response to the cardiac arrest, the brain injury that ultimately caused her death could have been avoided. Mr Gibson-Watt had called 999 after his wife started screaming, wailing and crawling around on all fours on 13 November. He told the inquest at West London Coroner's Court that she was suffering delusions that their daughter had died. He also told the court that he and Alice met when she was 18 and he was 21. They had married nine years later. \"Our romance was long and wonderful,\" he said afterwards. \"We were a lucky couple: best friends, soul mates with entwined interests.\" He added that one day he will tell his four-year-old daughter about her wonderful mother. \"Alice insisted on a drug-free birth to give her daughter the very best start possible. She was enthralled by motherhood,\" he said. Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental illness that affects around one in 1,000 women after they have a baby. The main symptoms are hallucinations - hearing and seeing things that aren't there - and delusions - thoughts that are not likely to be true. Experiencing psychosis tends to happen within the first two weeks after giving birth, but it can develop later too. It can severely alter someone's thinking, emotions and behaviour. Experts don't know why it occurs in some women, but fluctuations in hormones and changing sleep patterns are thought to play a role. Women are more likely to develop the illness if another member of their family has had it too.", "qas": [{"question": "Who died after being restrained by police and paramedics ?", "answers": [], "id": 6870}, {"question": "Who died after being restrained by whom ?", "answers": [], "id": 6871}, {"question": "Who was killed after being restrained by police and paramedics ?", "answers": [], "id": 6872}, {"question": "Who was suffering from post-partum psychosis ?", "answers": [], "id": 6873}, {"question": "What was the cause of the woman 's death ?", "answers": [], "id": 6874}, {"question": "Who restrained the woman before she died ?", "answers": [], "id": 6875}, {"question": "What did the inquest hear from the woman 's mother ?", "answers": [], "id": 6876}, {"question": "WhatWas the cause of the woman 's death post-partum psychosis ?", "answers": [], "id": 6877}, {"question": "What did the inquest hear that was happening to the woman before she died ?", "answers": [], "id": 6878}, {"question": "What was the condition the woman died from ?", "answers": [], "id": 6879}]}], "title": "Alice Gibson-Watt, 34, died in"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Labour MP Keith Vaz said Coca-Cola was marketing a \"real health hazard\".

Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting head Thomas Homan said more than 100 people could have been in the truck at one point. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart store and asked for water. San Antonio police chief William McManus said in a press briefing that the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the people were helpless victims of \"ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo\". Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month.

It blasted off on a Vega rocket from South America just after 13:40 GMT. The test data could also inform future Mars landing technologies. The demonstrator flew east around the globe, before coming down in the water west of the Galapagos Islands at about 15:20 GMT. The wedge-shaped IXV (Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle) was designed to gather information on how space objects fall back to Earth. Commenting on the flight, Esa director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain said: \"It couldn't have gone better. \"But the mission itself is not over because now it is necessary to analyse all the data gathered during the flight.\" At the time the craft re-entered the atmosphere, it was moving at 7.5km/s. As it pushed against the air, the temperatures on its leading surfaces would have soared to 1,700C. Flaps and thrusters controlled the trajectory, ensuring the IXV came down close to a recovery ship. A parachute system deployed in the very late stages of the flight and put the two-tonne vehicle gently in the ocean. Floatation balloons came out to stop it from sinking. Europe's expertise on re-entry technologies is more limited than, say, the US's or Russia's - something it wants to change with the help of the IXV. Esa's project manager Giorgio Tumino told BBC News: \"Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit. \"So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - we need to master this third leg as well as other spacefaring nations.\" Esa has already approved a follow-on spacecraft, called Pride, which looks very similar in design to the X-37B, a robotic craft operated by the American military. No-one is quite sure what missions are flown by the X-37B, but they are likely to include the early testing of new technologies for future satellites. This could be a role also for Europe's Pride vehicle. In-orbit servicing of satellites is a capability often discussed in this context as well. Esa nations will meet shortly to define these roles. \"We need still to agree with all the member states all the different types of operations in orbit.

Josh Beer, from the Illustrious Pub Company, in Cambridgeshire, said: \"More of our customers gravitated towards deals and offers in the past month, it feels as though they were biding their time, and cutting back until they became more confident in the economy.\" The Visa figures show overall spending was 08% lower than in 2016, the first fall since September 2013. The findings chime with official data from the Office for National Statistics, which shows that wage growth is falling back while inflation is rising, causing a squeeze on household incomes as they fail to keep pace with shop prices. The latest official figures showed wage growth behind inflation for the first time since mid-2014, and the Bank of England has said it expects this to get worse.

Having been one the major players behind Manchester's recent cultural renaissance, she takes on the leadership of the Tate with palpable energy and ambition. Her intention, she says, is to change the Tate in the next 20 years as much as her predecessor - Sir Nicholas Serota - changed it in the last two decades. Given that he oversaw the transformation of the museum from a respected gallery in Pimlico (with a regional outlet in Liverpool) into a global mega art brand, it is a bold claim. Sir Nicholas built his Tate empire with bricks and mortar, refurbishing existing galleries and creating new venues such as Tate Modern. Balshaw will take a different approach with her expansionist agenda, focussing more on people rather than real estate. Roughly speaking, according to statistics collected by the newly-renamed Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, around 50% of the British population visit a museum or gallery at least once a year, meaning - of course - 50% do not. These absentees are her target audience. She says: \"We should absolutely reasonably expect 75% of the population to love the fact we have a national collection and feel happy to be visiting Tate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and every young person should be given the opportunity to think and play and experiment in the spaces Tate holds. And that is a big, big shift.\" Her clarity of vision is impressive, but her ability to explain how it will be realised is less exact. She wants to usher in \"an easier language to talk about the joy of art\" but couldn't be specific beyond saying that arcane words should be either avoided or explained. She talks of a radical transformation in audience profile, of a lack of representation of people from BAME background among the staff and in the sector more generally. But when it comes to the organisation she is now leading, which is to be the agent for the change she desires, she says, \"it's not that we need to change anything particularly\". There is no doubt she is sincere in her ambitions, and probably more capable than most in the museum and gallery world when it comes to broadening the audience. But if she is to be successful in her aims she will need to take a leaf out of Sir Nicholas's job application for the Tate director's job back in the 1980s - in which he wrote that for the institution to change he would need to grasp the nettle.

WELSH LABOUR. Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES. The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3%, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU. It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7% and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP. UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6% less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.", "qas": [{"question": "What did Labour win in Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 7190}, {"question": "Which party has won Wales since the New Labour landslide ?", "answers": [], "id": 7191}, {"question": "Where did Labour win in 1997 ?", "answers": [], "id": 7192}, {"question": "When did the New Labour landslide happen in Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 7193}, {"question": "When was the last election when Labour won in Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 7194}, {"question": "When was the last time that a Labour won in Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 7195}, {"question": "Who won the Wales general election in 1997 ?", "answers": [], "id": 7196}, {"question": "For how long has Labour won in Wales ?", "answers": [], "id": 7197}, {"question": "In what year did the New Labour landslide happen ?", "answers": [], "id": 7198}, {"question": "Where did Labour win an election in 1997 ?", "answers": [], "id": 7199}]}], "title": "With all the results now"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "He said the prime minister's position owed less to \"great philosophers\" than the hapless sidekick from the 1980s BBC TV show Blackadder.

During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn and Mrs May argued over the government's yet-to-be-announced stance for when negotiations for leaving the European Union begin next year. The Labour leader accused the prime minister of presiding over a \"shambolic Tory Brexit\" and called for clarity and warned of the effect of it might have on the Irish border. Mrs May pledged no return to the \"borders of the past\", saying a Common Travel Area had existed since 1923, and accused Mr Corbyn of trying to \"frustrate the will of the British people\" over the EU referendum. The government has said it will formally trigger Brexit talks by the end of next March, but has consistently refused to offer a \"running commentary\" on its negotiating stance. Prime Minister's Questions took an unusual turn when Mr Corbyn made reference to Baldrick, the turnip-loving and intellectually challenged servant to Rowan Atkinson's 1980s historical comedy character Edmund Blackadder. He said: \"When you're searching for the real meaning and the importance behind the prime minister's statement (on the recent European Council summit), you have to consult the great philosophers. \"The only one I could come up with is Baldrick, who says, 'Our cunning plan is to have no plan.\"' This was a reference to Baldrick's frequent claim to have a \"cunning plan\" to deal with the trickiest situations, but which nearly always turned out to be less than brilliant.

Of course, the actor playing Baldrick was a member of the Labour Party, as I recall.\" Sir Tony is a long-serving activist who has chaired proceedings at the party's annual conference - he has also been a recent critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

The Crystal Palace player was unfortunate to be wrong-footed by Nani's deflection for the second goal. Watchful against the threat of Ronaldo cutting inside from Portugal's left, the Reading defender was kept busy by the likes of Renato Sanches and Nani and struggled to influence the game in attack. Switched to the left side of Wales' three centre-backs in Ben Davies' absence, the West Brom man timed his advances well to make interceptions. Beaten by Ronaldo for Portugal's opening goal but won a team-high eight aerial duels. Made some strong early challenges, particularly on Cristiano Ronaldo, to assert his authority on the game. The Swansea City skipper led by example, winning 100% of his 50-50 contests with Portugal players. Making his first international start since March 2015, he competed well in the air as Portugal sought to make the most of Ronaldo's aerial prowess. Wales might have missed Ben Davies' distribution but his replacement was solid defensively. Like Gunter, kept on the back foot by Portugal's attacking players. Pushed forward but, when he got into promising positions, struggled to provide quality crosses. An early booking for a foul on Nani made his job of protecting Wales' defence difficult, but still the Liverpool midfielder buzzed around with intent. Typically sound in possession but not as influential as he has been earlier in the tournament. Showed imagination with a low corner which led to a chance for Gareth Bale but had only limited influence in open play before being replaced by Sam Vokes shortly after Portugal's second goal.

Forced deeper as Portugal's midfield gained control in the second half, the Leicester Premier League winner had to curb his attacking instincts. Trademark runs from deep and at a startling pace had Portugal's defenders backtracking in the first half but his influence waned in the second period. The Real Madrid forward's audacious long-range shot was Wales' last effort. Brimming with confidence following his stunning goal in the quarter-final win over Belgium, the free agent stretched Portugal's defence with his powerful running. He was starved of the ball in the second half, however, as the match wore on. Brought on shortly after Wales fell 2-0 behind, the Burnley striker failed to connect meaningfully with any of the crosses which came his way.

She warned the police policy was causing \"tension\" between the services. In January 2015, Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer wrote in confidence to NHS bosses and told them police would take mentally ill people to hospital and other places of safety, rather than keep them in custody. It said that police would be encouraged to call an ambulance if they detained a mentally ill adult, and should take a child to an A&E Department. Dr Hicks, mental health lead for the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said \"agitated mental health patients\" were brought into the hospital by officers, which \"created real tension between us and the police\". She said the police policy had coincided with an overall rise in mental health admissions after normal working hours finished at 17:00 BST, which she estimated to be around 20%. \"We don't feel we can deliver that safe nurturing space those patients need,\" she added.

Mr Sawyer said mental health calls put \"an awful lot of time and pressure\" on officers as they know \"they're not the best person to deal with them\".

A record number of prisoners killed themselves in 2016, figures have shown. The government said an internal inquiry into deaths in custody was under way. The report by the two charities, which is based on interviews with healthcare staff working in prisons, found that the majority of prisoners have multiple and complex needs, including poor mental health. But many do not get access to mental health support. The report claims that staff shortages, a \"toxic\" working environment and a failure to recognise the impact of prison on both prisoners and staff, all contribute to an \"unsafe environment\". It recommends three steps to help prisons shift away from a \"primarily punitive approach\" to a culture centred on wellbeing, recovery and rehabilitation:. Sarah Hughes, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, said: \"We need to bring about a culture change in prisons that puts safety top of the agenda, that understands the traumas both prisoners and staff too often live with, and that means people get the right help when they need it.\" Last month, the Ministry of Justice said there were 119 self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales in 2016 - 29 more than the previous year and the highest number since records began in 1978. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said it was \"time for action\". She added: \"No-one should be so desperate while in the care of the state that they take their own life. \"Staff who work in prisons should never feel so under pressure that they cannot stop and listen.\" A government spokeswoman said: \"Increased support is now available to those at risk of self-harm or suicide, especially in the first 24 hours, and we have invested in mental health awareness training for staff. \"An internal inquiry is also under way looking at all deaths in custody in the last year, to further our understanding of why these events happen.\"", "qas": [{"question": "In addition to England , what other country 's prisons are failing mental health inmates ?", "answers": [], "id": 7460}, {"question": "In addition to England , what other country 's prisons are failing to help mental health inmates ?", "answers": [], "id": 7461}, {"question": "Who are prisons failing to recognize the mental health needs of ?", "answers": [], "id": 7462}, {"question": "In addition to England , what other country 's prisons are reported to be failing to help mental health inmates ?", "answers": [], "id": 7463}, {"question": "Along with Wales , in what country are most prisons failing mental health inmates ?", "answers": [], "id": 7464}, {"question": "InPrison in England and what other country are failing to recognise mental health needs ?", "answers": [], "id": 7465}, {"question": "Who are the prisoners in England and Wales failing to recognize 's mental health needs ?", "answers": [], "id": 7466}, {"question": "Along with Wales , in what country are some prisons failing mental health inmates ?", "answers": [], "id": 7467}, {"question": "In addition to England , what other country 's prisons are reported to be failing to treat mental health needs ?", "answers": [], "id": 7468}, {"question": "Who are the prisoners in England and Wales failing to acknowledge mental health needs of ?", "answers": [], "id": 7469}]}], "title": "Prisoner distress, self-harm and suicide"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The 20-year-old would have been part of Paul Simpson's squad in South Korea, but opted to remain in Glasgow. \"I made a decision and I'm proud of that decision,\" Roberts said. \"I've got a massive final to play.

The upgrade work will see the six-mile \"missing link\" completed on the M8 in North Lanarkshire. Improvements to the Raith Interchange and widening of key sections of the M8, M73 and M74 are also taking place. The work will see upgrading of the M8 between Baillieston and Newhouse to motorway standard. This will require upgrades to the connections to the M73 motorway at Baillieston and a new junction at Shawhead, which will connect to the A725 East Kilbride road. There will also be new junctions at Eurocentral and Chapelhall. Improvements to the Raith Interchange near Hamilton in Lanarkshire include realignment of the A725. There will be an underpass for the A725 and bridges carrying the Raith roundabout. The improvements are expected to cut journey times by up to 18 minutes for the busiest sections of the M8. Graeme Reid, project sponsor for Transport Scotland, said: \"We have reached a pivotal point in this three year project, involving traffic management measures which are likely to cause some disruption to road users, especially at peak times. \"The biggest challenge on a project of this scale is to keep the 100,000 vehicles that use these key routes every day moving and to ensure disruption to road users is minimised as far as is practically possible.\" He added: \"The installation of safety cameras is a tried and tested mechanism that improves safety for both road users and the workforce during what will be an extremely busy period in terms of construction.\" The first traffic restrictions and safety cameras will be brought in along the M74 northbound and southbound from J6 Hamilton to J3A Daldowie. Three narrow lanes will be in operation to allow the construction of a new lane and hard shoulder. Improvements at the Raith Interchange will see speed restrictions and temporary lane closures and diversions to allow excavation works to start on the construction of the A725 underpass below the existing roundabout. The new underpass will link the Bellshill Bypass and the East Kilbride Expressway (A725) and create a new route for traffic, cutting out the heavily-congested Raith Junction.

MPs on the justice select committee said the charge, which is not means-tested, created \"serious problems\" and was often \"grossly disproportionate\". Ministers said it was under review. The fee is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals \"pay their way\". But chairman of the cross-party committee Bob Neill said: \"The evidence we have received has prompted grave misgivings about the operation of the charge, and whether, as currently framed, it is compatible with the principles of justice.\" He added that \"in many cases it is grossly disproportionate\" and created \"perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs\". The committee's report said the lack of discretion for judges and magistrates on the level of the charge was creating \"unacceptable consequences within the criminal justice system\". It cited the case of a woman who had admitted stealing a four-pack of Mars Bars worth 75p, saying she \"had not eaten in days\" after her benefits were sanctioned. She was ordered to pay a \u00a3150 criminal courts charge on top of her \u00a373 fine, \u00a385 costs, a \u00a320 victim surcharge and 75p compensation. The committee also said it was \"highly sceptical\" of government claims that the charges could deliver a net revenue of \u00a380m to \u00a3160m a year by 2023 - with an annual cost of collection of about \u00a320m and a \u00a35m bill for imprisoning defaulters. The Ministry of Justice said the concerns were noted and the operation of the fee was being kept under review. It comes after Justice Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament earlier this month that the charge was generating revenue and helping to \"ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate\". But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the criminal courts charge was \"unrealistic and unjust\" and called on the Ministry of Justice to \"suspend this policy immediately\". \"The innocent have been put under pressure to plead guilty, and ordering indigent people to pay money they simply do not have is never going to work,\" she said.", "qas": [{"question": "Who have grave misgivings about the use of criminal courts ?", "answers": [], "id": 7570}, {"question": "Who has grave misgivings about the use of criminal courts charge ?", "answers": [], "id": 7571}, {"question": "What charge have MPs raised grave misgivings about ?", "answers": [], "id": 7572}, {"question": "What does the criminal courts charge create ?", "answers": [], "id": 7573}, {"question": "What does the criminal courts charge encourage ?", "answers": [], "id": 7574}, {"question": "Who have grave misgivings about the use of criminal courts charge ?", "answers": [], "id": 7575}, {"question": "What charge has MPs raised grave misgivings about ?", "answers": [], "id": 7576}, {"question": "What do MPs have about criminal courts ?", "answers": [], "id": 7577}, {"question": "What do the MPs have about the criminal courts charge ?", "answers": [], "id": 7578}, {"question": "What have MPs raised grave misgivings about ?", "answers": [], "id": 7579}]}], "title": "Since April, convicted criminals in"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Syed, 35, is serving a life sentence for the murder of Hae Min Lee in 1999. His defence team is trying to reopen the case based on some of the questions raised in the Serial podcast over whether Syed had received a fair trial. A judge in Baltimore has allowed lawyers to submit new evidence for the first time since his conviction. Serial, which was released in weekly instalments at the end of last year, became a global hit, breaking records as the fastest podcast to reach five million downloads on iTunes. In it, journalists went through every detail in the investigation into the death of Lee, for which her ex-boyfriend Syed was convicted. Apparent errors and possible new evidence were discovered by the Serial team, leading to calls for a new investigation. Lawyers will now be allowed to present new evidence on two fronts: the reliability of mobile phone records and the testimony of a potential alibi. In the 2000 trial, prosecutors relied heavily on mobile phone records that allegedly placed Syed at a park in Baltimore where Lee's body was buried. Syed, who was 17 at the time, has always maintained his innocence. But a motion filed in court in August said a newly recovered mobile phone document showed \"the cell tower evidence was misleading and should have never been admitted at trial\". The new hearing, a date for which has yet to be decided, will also hear evidence from a potential alibi for Syed. Asia McClain, a friend of Syed's who was not heard in the original trial, claims to have seen him in a library at the time of the suspected killing. The fact that Syed's first lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to submit this evidence in the original trial was one of the arguments used to win him the right to appeal in February.

Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers.

But human rights watchdog Agora says at least 90 NGOs have used its hotline since last week to complain about visits by officials from the prosecutor-general's office, the justice ministry and the tax authorities. Foreign NGOs - such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Transparency International - have been among those targeted. Marina Gridneva, from the prosecutor-general's office, said the checks were being conducted \"in strict compliance with the current legislation\". Russian officials typically arrive unannounced, or at short notice, and request groups to hand over legal and financial documents, eyewitnesses say. Yelena Panfilova, who heads Transparency International's office in Moscow, said she was surprised that it was being checked again - just a month after a similar inspection. Law enforcement agents visited her office on Wednesday and gave her 24 hours to hand over paperwork. Ms Panfilova's links the checks with the new NGO legislation. \"We are on the list of NGOs that are visible and presumably receive foreign funding. As far as I understand, there is a big search for 'foreign agents' among the NGOs,\" she told the BBC. When the controversial law on NGOs was approved in November, a number of prominent Russian groups said they would not comply - even if that risked closure. They regard the term \"foreign agents\" as insulting, saying it harks back to Stalin-era purges. Memorial, an NGO gathering information about victims of Communism, reiterated this position earlier this week when law enforcement agents turned up at its office. \"Memorial\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 has carried out a research of people who 70 years ago were called agents by the authorities and then shot. For us, taking on the label of a foreign agent is unacceptable\", Memorial's Alexander Cherkasov told Reuters news agency. The \"foreign agent\" bill was one of several controversial laws adopted in the aftermath of last year's pro-democracy protests in Moscow. Other measures introduced tougher internet restrictions, outlawed \"gay propaganda\" and banned adoptions of Russian orphans by US parents. \"The scale of these inspections serves to reinforce the menacing atmosphere for civil society created by the adoption of last year's laws,\" Human Rights Watch's Rachel Denber told Reuters. The group's Moscow bureau was inspected last Thursday. Several NGOs, including Transparency International, reported that the visiting officials were also looking into the organisations' compliance with anti-extremist legislation.

New grammars are likely to help \"only a small proportion\" of the poorest pupils, it says. Ministers maintain that their proposals will improve social mobility. A government consultation on plans for more selective education closed earlier this month. \"Social mobility is a complex issue,\" said Prof Tom McLeish, chairman of the Royal Society's Education Committee. \"We support the government's commitment to ensuring all students fulfil their potential, regardless of their background. \"However, we are concerned that the approach to selective education outlined in the green paper may only support the small number of high ability disadvantaged pupils who do attend selective schools, at the cost of disadvantaged pupils who do not.\" Researchers from the Education Policy Institute, commissioned by the Royal Society, looked at the impact of selective education on the attainment of the most disadvantaged young people - those on free school meals - in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. The researchers found free school meals pupils performed less well in GCSE maths in areas where there were selective schools. In non-selective areas in 2015, 48.1% of free school meals pupils got a C or more, compared with 72.3% of pupils not eligible for the meals. But in selective areas the attainment gap was wider, with only 43.9% of free school meals pupils getting at least a C, compared with 74.8% of pupils not receiving the meals. The researchers found that free school meals pupils in selective schools performed very well, with 98% getting at least a C, compared with 99.2% of non-free school meals pupils. However, free school meals pupils make up only 3% of selective schools so their achievements are not enough to make any difference to \"an overall negative impact on the attainment of all free school meals pupils in GCSE mathematics in selective areas\", say the researchers. They also found that fewer free school meals pupils in selective areas took double or triple sciences at GCSE. \"We have found no evidence to suggest that overall educational standards for free school meals pupils in STEM subjects in England would be improved by an increase in the number of places in selective schools,\" the Royal Society concludes. Dr McLeish added that the best way to help every pupil achieve their potential is to make sure that they are taught by \"well-trained, motivated and supported, specialist science teachers\". Support is essential, he said, to help teachers \"draw out the natural curiosity and creativity that grows from a framework of knowledge in science\".

Similar organisations play the same role for football in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It was formed in 1863 and is the oldest football association in the world. As the first ever football association, it does not need to call itself the \"English\" FA. The FA is based at Wembley Stadium in London. It controls many different competitions, the most famous of which is the FA Cup. It is also responsible for appointing the manager of the men's, women's, and youth England football teams. Although it does not run the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, it does have some say in English football's biggest league. The FA has been accused of being old fashioned and out of date in the way it is run, and the people it has in power. The government has repeatedly called for the FA to be more of a reflection of modern society, and those who play the game. It also wants the organisation to change the way it makes decisions. The FA is run by a group of people called the FA Council, which has 122 members. Just eight of these members are women and only four are from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60. This is a big area where some people believe the FA needs to change. The government wants more women and people from ethnic minorities to have a say in how the FA is run. Other areas that the government wants to change are for fans to have more input, and changes to limit the power and influence of the Premier League. On 9 February, MPs in the House of Commons, had a debate about whether they believed the FA can change itself, or whether the government needs to step in to force changes. They voted that they had \"no confidence\" in the Football Association to make the changes. The vote itself does not have any powers or immediate effect on the FA, but it will be seen as a warning to the organisation that the government could force them to change if they don't act soon.

Several children were among the dead. More than one million migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2015 and the vast majority went from Turkey to Greece.

In Wednesday's raid the authorities seized 1,263 life jackets that failed to correspond to safety standards, Turkey's Dogan news agency said. The workshop was in the centre of Izmir, a major hub for refugees and migrants. Four people were found working in the workshop, including two young Syrian girls, the news agency said. It did not publish the girls' ages. The confiscated life jackets have been sent to the local police for examination and an investigation has been launched. It comes one day after the bodies of more than 30 migrants were washed up in Turkey. Their boats capsized in bad weather on the way to the Greek island of Lesbos, the authorities say. Turkish media published harrowing images of the corpses, many still wearing life jackets that had apparently been of no use. Migrants are continuing to arrive on the Greek islands every day, despite the wintry weather. Lesbos is by far the most popular destination for migrants leaving Turkey. More than 500,000 reached the island in 2015. Late last year, Turkey reached a deal with the European Union to tighten its borders and reduce the numbers crossing to Greece in return for \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.1bn) and political concessions. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff. Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos. Last month, a \u00a31.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's \u00a31.4bn offer. Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for \u00a3340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business. Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to \u00a3515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers. The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added. Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been \"another rather eventful period\" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales. Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos. The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a \"world-leading\" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.\" Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.

However, on Thursday, the PPS said that \"following careful consideration of the evidence\", it had decided not to prosecute him. The coroner is now giving consideration to the scheduling of dates for the inquest to recommence. No one has been convicted for the Kingsmills atrocity. The victims - textile factory workers - were shot dead when an IRA gang ambushed their mini-bus in 1976 near the County Armagh village of Kingsmills.

The collection was probably dispersed over time through ploughing. This was Mr Crawford's fourth time at a treasure trove inquest. He said his success was about \"knowing where to go\" and \"having a fair idea of where to look\". \"There is more chance of finding something where you know people would have been living 1,000 years ago,\" he added.

The operation was being filmed by four Australian journalists with Channel 9's 60 Minutes programme. The mother, Sally Faulkner, was soon arrested, as were the journalists, two British men and two Lebanese men. The children were returned to their father's custody. The judge overseeing the case has warned that he views the \"child recovery\" operation as a criminal case. Ms Faulkner had said she had not seen the young children since her estranged husband, Ali Elamine, took them from Australia to Beirut on holiday. She flew to Lebanon earlier this month with two employees of the UK-based company Child Abduction Recovery International (CARI) to recover them, accompanied by the 60 Minutes team. CCTV footage broadcast by Lebanese TV appears to show the six-year-old and four-year-old being bundled into a car by several men on a busy street in southern Beirut. They had been heading to school with a domestic worker and their paternal grandmother, who said she was knocked to the ground during the abduction. It was previously reported that the judge was pushing for Ms Faulkner to reach a custody agreement with Mr Elamine. But Mr Elamine has now said he will not drop abduction charges against Ms Faulkner because it could see the others involved released as well. Judge Rami Abdullah said on Monday that the so-called \"recovery\" operation amounted to a kidnapping attempt. \"This is not a custody case, they are involved in kidnapping two kids,\" he said, according to News Corp Australia. The case has been adjourned until Wednesday to allow both sides to negotiate. Those arrested face kidnapping, assault and association charges, which can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. According to reports, Judge Abdullah interviewed 60 Minutes' prominent reporter Tara Brown and Ms Faulkner briefly on Monday before the handcuffed pair were escorted out a side exit to waiting police cars. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been in contact with her Lebanese counterpart. \"The law in Lebanon is quite different to Australian law,\" she said in an interview with Network Ten. \"It's based on a French system, so there have been arrests, then an investigation and then an investigating judge determines whether charges will be laid and I understand we're at that stage of the proceedings,\" Ms Bishop said.

But the beauty queen, 25, faced a backlash on social media. It comes as the Trump administration battles to overturn Obamacare, which aimed to extend insurance coverage to the 15% of Americans who lack it. Earlier this month the lower chamber of the US Congress passed a new healthcare act that Democrats say will leave millions uninsured. However, Republicans in the Senate have indicated they will cast it aside and write a new law. Asked during Sunday's pageant in Las Vegas whether healthcare was a privilege or a right, Miss McCullough said: \"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege.\" She added: \"As a government employee, I'm granted healthcare and I see first hand that for one to have healthcare, you need to have jobs. \"We need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have healthcare as well as jobs to all American citizens worldwide.\" Her remarks divided liberal-minded and conservative-minded viewers. Some were quick to criticise her stance. Miss McCullough - who was born in Italy and was representing Washington DC - was also asked if she considered herself to be a feminist but said she preferred the term \"equalism\" and said men and women had equal opportunity in US workplaces. \"I don't really want to consider myself - try not to consider myself like this die-hard, you know, like, 'Oh, I don't really care about men',\" said the contestant, who says she wants to see more women employed in government science roles. Some people on social media supported her views. Obamacare has been opposed by Republicans since it was first proposed in 2009. Republicans say the law imposes too many costs on business and describe it as a \"job killer\", although the number of jobs in the healthcare sector has risen since it was introduced.

Ms Saliu and her daughters were arrested by UK Border Agency staff on Wednesday. Anj Handa, a close friend of the family, said: \"Afusat was meant to be given 72 hours' notice before she was actually deported, and the Home Office totally ignored that. Finally they have accepted that. \"She is not going to be deported tonight or tomorrow morning but that does not mean she is not going to be deported. \"She has been given an overnight reprieve but the campaign is still very much ongoing and the lawyers are still working on her judicial review. \"We are still urging people to keep up the pressure to help her stay in this country while the case is reviewed.\" Ms Saliu's solicitors BP Legal have launched a judicial review in an attempt to allow her to remain in the UK. They say officials have ignored their own guidelines by ordering her deportation before the review is heard. Earlier, Sir Richard Branson said in a statement: \"Without knowing the specifics on the case it is very difficult to comment in detail on a legal decision taken by the Home Office. \"While Virgin Atlantic cannot confirm whether any passengers are or are not flying with them due to data protection laws, they would view any case like this with the safety and welfare of all passengers their primary concern. \"Regardless, if Afusat Saliu and her family are deported to Nigeria we call upon the UK and Nigerian governments to do all they can to protect the family and ensure they are not put at risk of female genital mutilation.\" Sir Richard described female genital mutilation (FGM) as an \"horrendous practice and a serious violation of internationally recognised human rights\". He called on the authorities to give the Saliu family all the support and protection possible. Ms Saliu fled from Nigeria in 2011 after her stepmother threatened to subject Bassy to female genital mutilation. Ms Saliu, who is herself a victim of FGM, was heavily pregnant at the time. She has said she fears both her daughters will be subjected to the practice and forced into marriage should they return to Nigeria. The family converted to Christianity in the UK and worry they would be targeted by Islamist militants Boko Haram in the west African country.

But the year marked an important milestone when - aged just 22 - he broke the 800m, one mile and 1,500m world records within the space of just 41 days. He was the first person to hold all three records at the same time. He also won Sports Personality of the Year. 1980 - First Olympic medals. Coe will always be remembered for his Olympic success. In 1980, amid intense rivalry with fellow British runner Steve Ovett, he won gold in the 1,500m in Moscow. He took silver in his preferred race - the 800m - finishing second to Ovett. 1984 - Second Olympic Gold. Despite spending months fighting illness, Coe returned to the Olympic track in Los Angeles four years later and became the first man to win successive 1,500m golds, beating fellow Briton Steve Cram into second (Ovett failed to finish the race). Coe was beaten into second again in the 800m by Joaquim Cruz. 1992 - Enters Parliament. After retiring from athletics in 1990, Coe pursued a career in politics and was chosen to fight the Falmouth and Camborne constituency for the Conservatives at the 1992 election. Coe beat the Liberal Democrat candidate by more than 3,000 votes and took his place in Parliament. He lost the seat in 1997 when Tony Blair's Labour Party swept to power. He briefly returned to politics as chief of staff to William Hague, when he was Leader of the Opposition. 2005 - Helps secure Olympics for London. Despite London lagging in third place behind Paris and Madrid in early stages, the UK capital secured the games under Coe's leadership. Sports commentators said a speech he made, shortly before the vote, helped turn the race in London's favour. \"This is almost entirely on a different planet to winning the gold medals,\" Coe said at the time. He went on to become Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is said to have been a key player in organising the Queen's appearance in the James Bond scene in the Games' opening ceremony. 2015 - Elected president of the IAAF.

The troubles of the Forth Road Bridge. Firms warn of bridge closure costs. The trains were very busy on Monday morning with increased queuing at Inverkeithing station but there was plenty of room at the park and ride facilities. Mr Mackay told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"As it stands right now, we believe that if we remedy and repair the fault, strengthen that, the bridge should be operational and open to all traffic on completion of the repair as per the timetable that I had outlined over the weekend.\" The Scottish government believes that the urgent work should be completed by the end of the festive season. It is estimated that about 70,000 vehicles use the Forth Road Bridge each day and Friday saw 11-mile rush hour tailbacks on the first full day of its closure. A plan has been put in place to help ease travel problems:. Mr Mackay insisted that the fault was not linked to a drop in finance because of the ending of bridge tolls in 2008. He said: \"This is a fault, that we believe on expert advice, only happened in the last few weeks. \"So on routine inspection, it was identified on Tuesday, expert engineering analysis studied that and inspected it fully, information went to ministers on Thursday evening, within minutes a decision was taken on advice on recommendation to close the bridge that evening.\" Mr Mackay added that the two reasons for closure were one, not to compromise safety, and second not further damage the structure of the bridge. Businesses are already feeling the impact of the repair work, including road hauliers. Martin Reid, the Scottish director of the Road Haulage Association, explained how relatively short journeys have doubled in length. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"What we have established is that even the most basic journeys where you are moving from West Lothian into Central Fife - journeys that would normally take 40 to 50 minutes are now taking two to three hours. \"There is on going costs to that, there are delays to service, additional costs attached to running idle when you are in traffic jams.

In 2006 police arrested Mr Dawson after four other men came forward claiming they were also abused as children between 1964 and 1986. In early 2007 another alleged victim came forward.

The White House said North Korea should \"focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations\". The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. \"We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made,\" he said. \"We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.\" Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009. Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year. A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex. But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there. The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons \"in quality and quantity\". It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with \"nuclear weapons any time\". However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear. Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim. North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces.

Chief executive Mike Coupe said he was confident its strategy would enable it to \"outperform our major peers\". German discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded rapidly in the UK, have been undercutting Sainsbury's and its rivals, including Tesco, Morrisons and Asda. The supermarket chain has fought back by cutting prices on its everyday products rather than run promotions. This quarter, it said it had cut the prices of broccoli, onions, Margherita pizza and its own-brand nappies. Mr Coupe said this strategy was working with customers \"consistently choosing\" Sainsbury's over its rivals. He also said its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos-owner Home Retail Group, which was completed at the beginning of this month, would speed up its plans to allow shoppers to get their goods in different ways. Sainsbury's, which already has 15 Argos stores within its own shops, said it would open 200 digital collection points in its stores by the end of the year. The supermarket group said Home Retail Group's like-for-like sales in the second quarter to 27 August, before it took over the firm, rose 2.3%. In another attempt to win more shoppers, and amid the threat of online giant Amazon's move into grocery deliveries, Sainsbury's said it was expanding a test of its one-hour grocery delivery service in London called \"Chop Chop\" with orders delivered by bicycle. The retailer said it would \"give customers more options to shop with us whenever and wherever they want\". Sainsbury's has reported two straight years of falling profits, and analysts expect another drop in the 2016-17 financial year. In May, the supermarket said underlying profits for the year to 12 March fell to \u00a3587m from \u00a3681m in the previous year. Shares in the group have fallen 9% over the past six months. John Ibbotson, director of retail consultancy Retail Vision, said Sainsbury's simpler pricing strategy and abolition of multi-buy promotions was \"distinctly underwhelming\" in the current brutal market conditions, but said Argos could help the firm. \"Argos should boost Sainsbury's bottom line in the short-term as well as improve its internet offer and logistics capability. \"But integrating the two firms will be time-consuming and distracting, and in the current environment Sainsbury's cannot afford to take its eye off its core grocery business, even for a second,\" he added.

The case against Ms Milke rested largely on a purported confession to that detective. An appeals court in Arizona ruled on Thursday that the she could not be tried again in relation to the killing. Prosecutors had pushed for a retrial but a panel of three judges said such a move would amount to double jeopardy. The two men who carried out the killing remain on death row. Debra Milke, then a 25-year-old insurance company clerk, was accused of dressing her son in his favourite outfit and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a local mall. Four-year-old Christoper Milke was then taken by two men to a desert area north of Phoenix where he was shot three times in the head. The original trial in 1990 found Ms Milke guilty of arranging the killing, based largely on an alleged confession made to Detective Armando Saldate. However, Mr Saldate did not record the confession and has since been implicated in several cases of misconduct including lying under oath. An appeals court ruled last year that prosecutors had known about Mr Saldate's misconduct but failed to disclose the information. \"Non-disclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke,\" the court said. Mr Saldate said he feared potential charges if he testified again, and in December a judge granted his request not to give evidence at any retrial. The court said on Thursday that it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence but merely on the validity of a retrial. Ms Milke's ex-husband, Arizona Milke, remained convinced of her guilt. \"She shouldn't walk free, because she's guilty,\" he told the Associated Press.

The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. He has been fighting a lengthy battle to be released early from jail. Pistorius was due to be released in August, but remained in prison after Justice Minister Michael Masutha made a last-minute intervention blocking it. The parole review board - the final recourse for parole disputes - met on Monday to decide if the star, 28, should be allowed out on house arrest. A definitive parole ruling is now unlikely to be made before the athlete in a separate legal process appeals against his conviction on 3 November in Bloemfontein. This ruling could result in him receiving a longer prison term. Mr Webber explained that the parole review board decided to refer the matter back to the original parole panel - the body accused by Mr Masutha of \"prematurely\" wanting to release him in August. There will not be much sympathy for Pistorius because many people felt that the judge erred by acquitting him of murder. The double amputee will have to remain behind bars because while his case joins the lengthy queue of other parole hearings that need to be heard, and there is no indication when this will happen. Legal experts say the decision by the justice minister Michael Masutha to intervene was correct in terms of the law. At the time of his intervention, Pistorius had been granted parole only six months into his five-year sentence. The law states clearly that an offender can only be considered for parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence, in this case 10 months. But because he has now served one-sixth of his sentence, he probably should be released by now. Prosecutors argue that the judge who presided over his trial did not apply the law correctly by acquitting him of murder. The judge instead found him guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide - equivalent to manslaughter. Reeva Steenkamp's parents are strongly against Pistorius' possible release, telling an Australian TV channel in August that the Paralympian has ruined their lives. \"He killed her. He admits he killed her. She's dead. Why didn't he just let her walk away?

Mr Sterling, 80, had been contesting his estranged wife Shelly's decision to sell the basketball team franchise to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Mr Sterling was banned from basketball for life after he was recorded making racist remarks in April. The Los Angeles court case focused on allegations that Mrs Sterling used medical tests of her husband's mental capacity to remove him as a member of the trust that owned the team, and deceived him into selling. Mr Sterling had originally agreed to the sale of the basketball team, but then revoked his blessing, saying he had been improperly removed from the trust. Mrs Sterling had told her husband to seek an evaluation by two doctors in May. The doctors declared him \"mentally incapacitated\" and unfit to administer his duties as trustee of the Sterling Family Trust. This in effect handed Mrs Sterling control of the Clippers. Judge Levanas of the California Superior Court said he found Mrs Sterling to be a more credible witness than her husband and that she had acted properly over the sale, the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles reports. He said that Mrs Sterling \"had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the team\". Mrs Sterling burst into tears as the ruling was delivered after the nine-day hearing, saying: \"I can't believe it's over.

Former PM Tony Abbott reintroduced knighthoods and damehoods in 2014. His controversial decision to grant Prince Philip a knighthood in January was widely seen as one of the factors which ended his term as leader. Mr Abbott at the time said Australia was honouring the Duke of Edinburgh's lifetime of \"service and dedication\", but later said the decision was \"injudicious\". He was ousted as leader of the centre-right Liberal Party by Mr Turnbull in September. Analysis: Jon Donnison, BBC News, Sydney. The decision to give Prince Philip a knighthood was hugely unpopular in Australia and seen as one of the biggest blunders of Tony Abbott's brief time in office. Now the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who in 1999 led Australia's unsuccessful campaign to abandon the monarchy and become a republic, has dropped knights and dames. The prime minister will have the chance to discuss the matter with the Duke of Edinburgh's son later this month, when Prince Charles comes to Australia on a royal visit. Mr Turnbull has recently said he remains a republican but says he does not regard the issue as a priority for his government. End of 'Knightmare' poses republican question. In a statement, Mr Turnbull said the Order of Australia awards were \"an important way of honouring the achievements and service of many Australians, including those unsung heroes who might not otherwise be recognised outside their local communities\". But he said his cabinet had recently reviewed the system and decided that the knighthoods and damehoods were \"not appropriate in our modern honours system\". Existing knights and dames would not be affected by the change, he said. The opposition Labor party welcomed the move, with shadow treasurer Chris Bowen describing the titles \"a national disgrace\". But he said it was \"not appropriate\" for Australia to be \"clinging onto imperial Britain through our honours system\". \"We shouldn't be celebrating the fact that knights and dames are gone, we should be lamenting the fact that they came back under this government,\" ABC News quoted him as saying. However, monarchist groups in Australia criticised the decision. Prominent Australian monarchist David Flint accused Mr Turnbull of trying to get \"revenge\" for the failed 1999 republic referendum, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Mr Flint, the head of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy organisation, said scrapping the titles means Australia can't give international recognition to its best soldiers, sportsmen and singers.

He said he mistook her for a burglar, while prosecutors argued that he shot her after a row at his upmarket home in the capital, Pretoria. The double amputee athlete was acquitted by Judge Masipa of both premeditated murder and the lesser murder charge of dolus eventualis, also known as common-law murder. In South African law, this charge applies if the accused knew they might kill someone but still went ahead with their course of action. Prosecutors argued that Judge Masipa misinterpreted the law when she cleared Pistorius of murder on the basis that he did not intentionally shoot Ms Steenkamp. Giving them permission to appeal in December, she said: \"I cannot say... that the prospect of success at the Supreme Court of Appeal is remote.\" The BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg says that defence lawyers are now challenging the judge's decision, and do not want the culpable homicide verdict to be overturned. On 13 March they will appear before Judge Masipa and intend to cite previous cases to back their argument that the appeal should not be allowed.

But is that seamless approach unravelling and could Brexit become a source of greater friction between the two governments? Both the Brexit Secretary David Davis and DUP leader Arlene Foster have been fond of talking about technology as the answer to Ireland's post-Brexit problems. Yes, they acknowledge, putting old-style customs checkpoints right on the border would be unacceptable for both political and security reasons. However, they then go on to suggest that provided businesses co-operate with computerised trusted trader schemes, and cameras with number plate recognition capability are installed some distance away from the frontier, all will be well. By contrast, the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has now warned that technology isn't the answer. Instead, he argues there is a need for a wider political agreement. What does that mean? On the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond hinted that the Irish favour moving customs controls to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border. This might sound geographically sensible, but the political implications should not be underestimated. Arlene Foster has previously said that putting a border down the middle of the Irish Sea, creating a divide between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, is something her party will not tolerate. So long as the DUP-Conservative parliamentary arrangement survives, that is a concern David Davis and Theresa May will have to take very seriously. But, if the DUP has the ear of the British government, then similarly as a loyal EU member state, Dublin has the ear of Michel Barnier's negotiating team. Since becoming foreign minister, Simon Coveney has not been shy about making his differences with the UK clear. He voiced his concern for Northern Ireland having special EU status, which contrasted with the position of his predecessor Charlie Flanagan. Some surmised this might only have been a slip of the tongue. However Mr Coveney's decision to let it be known he favoured a bespoke Irish Language Act (Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, the SDLP and Alliance's preference) over a hybrid bill (the DUP's suggestion) was a clear move to distance Dublin from the Northern Ireland Office's studied neutrality on the issue.

An ex-soldier rescued the victim. Davies, 26, of Mold, was convicted of attempted murder at the town's crown court in June and on Friday was told he must serve at least 14 years in prison. Judge Rhys Rowlands said Davies had developed \"extreme racist views\" and had been plotting to carry out a \"murderous attack\" in order to draw attention to himself. He said it was a \"planned and racially motivated attack\", as Dr Bhambra watched proceedings during his first appearance at the court in Mold. Speaking outside court, the victim said Davies was a \"coward\". \"He attacked me from behind and tried to behead me,\" Dr Bhambra said. \"By the grace of God I remained conscious and was able to defend myself. \"It is abhorrent that he has claimed that he tried to kill me in Lee Rigby's honour.\" During the trial, the court heard Dr Bhambra had been walking down an aisle in the store on 14 January when he felt a \"huge blow\" to the back of his head from the 30cm (12in) machete. Shopper Leanne Jones said she heard the words \"white power\" and that Davies was acting \"like a lunatic\" as he hacked Dr Bhambra with the machete. Another witness heard Davies say: \"Come here, this is for Lee Rigby\". The attack left Dr Bhambra, a 25-year-old dentist from Leeds, with two deep cuts to his scalp and another to his back, which went down to the muscle. An injury to his left hand caused major nerve, artery and tendon damage, leaving him in need of surgery for five hours. If it was not for the \"remarkably brave actions\" of soldier Peter Fuller, who came to his defence, Dr Bhambra would have been \"killed in front of many shoppers\", Judge Rowlands said. The trial heard items associated with white supremacy and Nazism were found at Davies's home, including banners, swastika badges and Combat 18 stickers. He also said he was \"absolutely fascinated\" with Islamic State and described the British man known as Jihadi John as his inspiration. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking Fusilier Rigby to death. After the trial concluded, Dr Bhambra's brother, Dr Tarlochan Singh Bhambra, said his family had \"no doubt\" that, had the \"racial disposition\" of the case been reversed, it would have been reported as an \"act of terror\". Det Ch Insp Alun Oldfield from North Wales Police said: \"This was a horrific attack and we are pleased with the sentence given to Davies. \"North Wales Police would like to commend the character and determination of Dr Bhambra and we are delighted that he is making such a good recovery. \"We also applaud the actions of Mr Peter Fuller, who has since been nominated for a national bravery award.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Who tried to behead a dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8490}, {"question": "Where did the man try to behead the dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8491}, {"question": "What did the dentist try to behead ?", "answers": [], "id": 8492}, {"question": "What was the sentence for the man who tried to behead the dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8493}, {"question": "In what store did the man try to behead the dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8494}, {"question": "What is the minimum sentence for attempting to behead a dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8495}, {"question": "In what store did a man try to behead a dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8496}, {"question": "What was the sentence given to the man who tried to behead the dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8497}, {"question": "Who was jailed for life for the attack on the dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8498}, {"question": "What was the sentence for the man who tried to behead a dentist ?", "answers": [], "id": 8499}]}], "title": "Dr Sarandev Bhambra was singled"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Joiners Arms, in Hackney Road, east London, shut in 2015. Regal Homes, which wants to build nine flats on the site, incorporating a bar, has agreed to the planning condition, believed to be the first of its kind. Tower Hamlets Council imposed the condition after the area lost 73% of its LGBT venues since 2006. The Joiners Arms originally opened as an LGBT venue in 1997 and included fashion designer Alexander McQueen among its customers. Regal Homes, which bought the site in 2014 - a year before the pub closed - has said it will give an LGBT operator first refusal on a 12-year lease for a new bar. It added the redevelopment was expected to create 1,073 jobs. The council has been working with Amy Lam\u00c3\u00a9, the mayor of London's \"Night Czar\", on how to bring back a LGBT venue to Hackney Road. In the application she says protecting LGBT venues is a \"key part\" of boosting London's \"night-time economy\". \"They contribute to London's economy, generate stronger and more resilient communities and are vital for many people's freedom of expression,\" she said. \"London has lost a quarter of its pubs and half of its nightclubs over the last 10 years.\" She added a University College of London report showed the capital had lost 58% of its LGBT venues over the past decade, while Tower Hamlets had lost slightly more. The czar said the report specifically cited the closure of The Joiner's Arms as one of several high-profile LGBT venues to shut in recent years. The development is expected to be given the go ahead at a meeting of the council's planning committee on Wednesday.

Ahly, who needed maximum points to keep up their hopes of progressing, dominated possession for much of the match in Alexandria. But Zesco, looking for a first semi-finals appearance, were quick on the counter-attack, and frustrated the Egyptians who are managed by former Tottenham boss Martin Jol. Kenya's Jesse Were took advantage of slack marking to nod the Zambians into a sixth-minute lead with Rami Rabia levelling on the half hour. Were struck again five minutes later, hitting the ball across goalkeeper Ahmed Adel into the far corner. Veteran striker Emad Meteb was brought on in the second half and snatched an 85th-minute equaliser for the Egyptians. His penalty area bicycle kick deflected off Kenyan David Owino, leaving goalkeeper Jacob Banda stranded. The result means that a semi-final place could be secured for Zesco and Wydad Casablanca, if Wydad can beat ASEC Mimosas on Sunday. Wydad, coached by Wales-born former Real Madrid manager John Toshack, want to get back on the winning trail in Rabat.

About 21 million refugees have been forced to flee their countries due to conflict or persecution, the UN says. Nine million people alone have been displaced by the six-year conflict in Syria while more than four million others have fled the war-torn country. \"We cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs. To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values,\" he added. The US has agreed to take in 110,000 new refugees in the 2017 fiscal year - which begins on 1 October- compared with the 85,000 refugees it expects by the end of September. The president's remarks come a day after a US and Russia-brokered ceasefire unravelled, partly due to a US-led air strike over the weekend that mistakenly killed Syrian soldiers. Tensions continued on Monday when a strike, which witnesses say came from the air, hit an aid convoy at Urum al-Kubra, destroying 18 UN lorries and killing about 20 civilians. The UN has since suspended all aid convoys to Syria in response. Both Russia and Syria have insisted their forces were not behind the strike. The president's announcement also included a pledge by countries to increase financial contributions to UN appeals and humanitarian groups by about $4.5b (\u00c2\u00a33.5b) over 2015 levels. Participating countries have vowed to help fund schools for a million refugee children as well as assist in helping one million refugees work legally. Mr Obama used his eighth and final UN address as president to call for a \"course correction\" to ensure that extremism and violence does not drive countries into a more divided world. \"Together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home,\" he said. Though he made no direct mention of the US, Mr Obama said wealthy countries with the resources should do more to help. In what appeared to be a dig at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he added: \"The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies.\" Hours earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also expressed concern over the conflict in Syria, saying there was \"no military solution\". \"Gulfs of mistrust divide citizens from their leaders.

The boxes have had a makeover for the project - painted green and fitted with a roof-mounted 86cm solar panel. Inside there are a variety of charging stations for different models of phone and a screen which shows adverts. The advertising screen is reinforced to deter vandals and the boxes are maintained daily and locked overnight. The project was the brainchild of two geography students turned entrepreneurs Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenny. Both studied at the London School of Economics (LSE) and were interested in finding new ways to use public spaces. \"I lived next to a phone box in my second year at uni and walked past it every day. I thought, 'There are 8,000 of these lying unused in London and we must be able to find a use for them,'\" explained Mr Craston. The solarbox can charge up to 100 phones a day, offering a 20% battery boost in 10 minutes. Since launch, about six people per hour use the booth, according to the founder. Running out of battery is a perennial problem for smartphone users as they become ever more powerful without an equivalent technology leap in battery life. \"On launch day, my phone ran out of battery and I genuinely had to use the box,\" said Mr Craston.

They are able to buy school shirts for ??1 and sweaters for ??2. But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said. The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - as well as Marks and Spencer, are selling the constituent parts of a generic school uniform for less than ??5 each. For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for ??1, Sainsbury's has put a ??2 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for ??1.75. Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim. The supermarkets accept this owing to the brand loyalty they gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries. The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising. Plus-size school uniforms launch. The picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes. Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth ??694m. The average price of a standard uniform has fallen by almost 21% since 2004, it said, with supermarkets increasing their market share. However, the total value of uniform and equipment sales has fallen from ??861m in 2004 to ??694m, the research group said. Neil Saunders, of Verdict, said that the quality of uniforms tended not to be at the same level as a decade ago. \"As long as they last, parents are not too concerned,\" he said. \"Children run around in these things, rip holes in them, and they fall apart anyway. As long as it lasts a term or half a year, parents are quite satisfied with that.\" He added that because wholesale prices of cotton and wool were rising, it would be difficult to cut prices any further. Last month, Marks and Spencer announced it had started to sell over-sized school uniforms for overweight children as young as four. Campaigners said it was simply commercial recognition of the fact obesity was a growing problem among younger pupils.

Michael Grenfell from the CMA said: \"Today's decision sends out a strong message that we will tackle illegal behaviour that is designed to stifle competition at the expense of customers - in this case, the NHS and, ultimately, taxpayers.\" But GSK said it disagreed with the ruling and was considering appealing. \"GSK and the generics companies entered into these agreements at the time in order to settle costly, complex and uncertain patent disputes,\" its spokesperson said. \"The agreements allowed the generics companies to enter the market early with a paroxetine product and ultimately enabled a saving of over \u00a315m to the NHS.\" The CMA pointed out that after generic paroxetine entered the market properly at the end of 2013, average prices for the drug fell more than 70% in two years.", "qas": [{"question": "Who fined GlaxoSmithKline ?", "answers": [], "id": 8910}, {"question": "What kind of company is GlaxoSmithKline ?", "answers": [], "id": 8911}, {"question": "In which country was GlaxoSmithKline fined by competition regulators ?", "answers": [], "id": 8912}, {"question": "In what country was GlaxoSmithKline fined by competition regulators ?", "answers": [], "id": 8913}, {"question": "What was GlaxoSmithKline fined for by the UK competition watchdog ?", "answers": [], "id": 8914}, {"question": "In which country was GlaxoSmithKline fined for stifling competition ?", "answers": [], "id": 8915}, {"question": "What is GlaxoSmithKline 's RRB ?", "answers": [], "id": 8916}, {"question": "What is GlaxoSmithKline known by ?", "answers": [], "id": 8917}, {"question": "Which company was fined by the UK competition watchdog ?", "answers": [], "id": 8918}, {"question": "What is GlaxoSmithKline 's parent company ?", "answers": [], "id": 8919}]}], "title": "The Competition and Markets Authority"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "It is a joint venture between Lacuna Developments, based in Holywood, County Down, and the Welsh firm Watkin Jones.

Spirit of Shankly (SOS) will vote on the issue on Saturday. Its chair, Jay McKenna, said the impact of the Hillsborough disaster might have left fans \"behind the curve\" in the debate about reintroducing standing. The club said it would \"listen\" to fans' views if legislation requiring all-seater stadiums were ever changed. Liverpool said their fans were in a \"uniquely complex and difficult position\" when contemplating safe standing because the requirement for all-seater stadiums in England's top flight came in response to the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 fans were killed in a crush at an FA Cup semi-final in 1989. SOS has discussed the issue with members since September and on Tuesday will meet with survivors of the disaster and families of those killed. It will hold an open meeting in the city this weekend, then open an online vote. The vote will seek to clarify an official stance on safe standing for the group's members but a separate vote will also collate the views of non-members in order to build a supporter-wide consensus. \"We think it's important that everybody has a say,\" added McKenna. \"It can be a factual and emotional debate. We are fully aware of that. In the past nobody has wanted to talk about it, perhaps for fear of upsetting people. If we don't have this conversation, it will happen around us. \"We just want to know, are you in favour of it or not?\" Government legislation would need to change for safe standing to be introduced. The Premier League wrote to its 20 clubs last month to assess whether they would be interested in trialling safe standing. Debate over the issue has grown since Celtic introduced around 3,000 rail seats at Celtic Park at the beginning of last season. The Scottish club will be represented at Saturday's open SOS meeting, as will the Sports Ground Safety Authority, who oversaw regulation surrounding the move to all-seater stadiums. But Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, which helps families of more than 70 of those killed at Hillsborough, reiterated the body's objection to safe standing. \"We have had a vote not so long ago with the families and they voted against any form of standing whatsoever,\" she said. \"We don't call it safe standing we call it unsafe standing.\" A separate organisation - the Hillsborough Justice Campaign - said it remained \"neutral\" on any move to safe standing but chair Kenny Derbyshire said it was now \"imperative\" people had their say.

Writing in the Financial Times, the director general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva, said suspension of the quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production. \"The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply. \"The situation reminds us that even the most advanced agricultural systems are subject to the vagaries of the weather, leading to volatility in supplies and prices, not just on domestic markets, but also internationally.\" Concerns about the impact of the dry weather in the US pushed maize prices up by 23% in July, according to the latest FAO food price index. But the US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the biofuels standard was having a positive impact on the country. \"It is impacting in a positive way the cost of gasoline in this country - some estimates put it at 25 cents to as much as $1.30 less for gas because we have a biofuel industry. \"There are jobs connected to that industry and less reliance on foreign oil. The question is: Is the market responding to concerns about supply and the answer is yes. \"Exports are down just a bit and ethanol production is down from between 10% and 30%, depending on the part of the country.\" By law, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must be produced in the US this year. The country's Renewable Fuel Standard, as the law is known, was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported oil. It has long been controversial, with many blaming the quota for pushing up corn prices. The United Nations is not alone in calling for the quota to be suspended. Livestock producers in the US, worried about the cost of cattle feed, also want it scrapped and the governments of China, India and France have expressed concerns about the policy.", "qas": [{"question": "Who asked that the US suspend its controversial biofuels quota ?", "answers": [], "id": 9020}, {"question": "What is the United States biofuels quota for ?", "answers": [], "id": 9021}, {"question": "Which is a controversial biofuels quota for corn ?", "answers": [], "id": 9022}, {"question": "Which country has the United Nations asked to suspend its controversial biofuels quota ?", "answers": [], "id": 9023}, {"question": "Who asked that the US suspend its biofuels quota ?", "answers": [], "id": 9024}, {"question": "What has the UN called for the US to suspend ?", "answers": [], "id": 9025}, {"question": "Which country has the United Nations called on to suspend its controversial biofuels quota ?", "answers": [], "id": 9026}, {"question": "Which country has the United Nations called upon to suspend its controversial biofuels quota ?", "answers": [], "id": 9027}, {"question": "What does the United Nations want the US to suspend ?", "answers": [], "id": 9028}, {"question": "What is the United States mandated biofuels quota for ?", "answers": [], "id": 9029}]}], "title": "Under US law, 40% of"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The charity said tests confirmed all of the cats near Victor Avenue, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, had ingested the toxic substance.

The discovery, the scientists say, could inspire new robot design. It is published in the Royal Society journal Interface. Kai-jung Chi, from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan, and her colleagues investigated the jumping ability of Adanson's house spider, a common arachnid that jumps when it hunts, in order to surprise its prey. Ultimately, Dr Chi and her team hope to learn exactly how these creatures fine-tune and control their jumping manoeuvres, to aid the design of miniature robots able to move in similar ways. Dr Chi's colleague, PhD student Yung-Kang Chen, filmed the spiders at 1,000 frames per second, and slowed down the resulting footage. They compared the movements of the Adanson's spider with those of a species of jumping spider that does not use a silk dragline. \"We analysed the motion and body orientation throughout the jumps,\" Dr Chi told BBC News. This revealed that the Adanson's spider used its dragline to control the orientation of its body mid-air and to brake as it landed. The non-silk jumping spider would often lose balance - tipping forward and onto its back upon landing. \"[The silk means that the spiders] can land in the optimal position to rapidly initiate prey capture,\" Dr Chi said. The results, she said, suggested that the spiders were taking up the slack in their silk dragline by using the valve in their spinning system. These super-fast adjustments mean that silk provides more than just a safety line for a jumping spider. Dr Chi said that the \"adjustable silk tension\" could provide \"biological inspiration\" for future manoeuvrable robot design.", "qas": [{"question": "Who discovered how jumping spiders fine-tune and control their jumping manoeuvres ?", "answers": [], "id": 9070}, {"question": "What do jumping spiders fine-tune ?", "answers": [], "id": 9071}, {"question": "What group discovered how jumping spiders fine-tune and control their jumping manoeuvres ?", "answers": [], "id": 9072}, {"question": "What kind of spider did scientists discover ?", "answers": [], "id": 9073}, {"question": "What group of people discovered how jumping spiders fine-tune and control their jumping manoeuvres ?", "answers": [], "id": 9074}, {"question": "What group of people discovered how jumping spiders fine-tune their jumping manoeuvres ?", "answers": [], "id": 9075}, {"question": "What are researching how jumping spiders fine-tune ?", "answers": [], "id": 9076}, {"question": "What species of spider did scientists discover how to control jumping manoeuvres ?", "answers": [], "id": 9077}, {"question": "What is a type of arachnid ?", "answers": [], "id": 9078}, {"question": "What type of spider did scientists discover ?", "answers": [], "id": 9079}]}], "title": "Slow-motion footage revealed the spiders"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "They feature on the International Impac Dublin Literary Award's 2016 longlist, alongside BBC journalist Kirsty Wark's debut The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle.

Lake Okeechobee, the largest freshwater body in the state, is contaminated with runoff that includes human waste, animal feed and fertiliser. The process sent millions of gallons of the nutrient-heavy water into the river and triggered the growth of blue-green algae on some of Florida's southern rivers and beaches. Samples taken in the river near Palm City and Stuart tested positive for hazardous levels of toxins. If ingested, the toxic algae could cause nausea and vomiting and rash or hay fever if touched or inhaled. Beaches along Florida's Treasure Coast were closed last week in response to the expansion of the green sludge. Though many of the beaches have reopened, officials recommend that people stay away from the hazardous waterways. Governor Scott blamed the polluted waters on water storage limitations and the federal government. \"Florida's waterways, wildlife and families have been severely impacted by the inaction and negligence of the federal government not making the needed repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike and Florida can no longer afford to wait,\" Scott said.

The hospital involved has categorically rejected the family's claims. The woman's burial has been postponed while further investigations are carried out. Milluzzo was admitted to Cannizzaro hospital in the Sicilian city of Catania on 29 September after suffering complications and going into premature labour in her 19th week of pregnancy. She had had fertility treatment at another health centre. She was in a stable condition in hospital for more than a fortnight but on 15 October her blood pressure and temperature dropped and her condition worsened. According to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: \"As long as it's alive, I will not intervene.\" No action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said. Overnight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died. Angelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong. \"There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances,\" he told the Ansa news agency. \"I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them.\" Sources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a \"conscientious objector\". Catania's prosecutor has halted Milluzzo's burial while a post mortem examination is carried out. There are unconfirmed reports that some of the hospital's medical staff may be investigated. A senior doctor at the hospital, Paolo Scollo, told the Corriere website that all the doctors in his department were \"objectors\", and external doctors were called in when necessary. \"However, in this case we're talking about a spontaneous miscarriage, no external help was needed. So we do not think the doctor was negligent,\" he said. It emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. Italy is a predominantly Catholic country. But in southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%. Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, provided it is during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After 12 weeks it is allowed only if the life of the mother is at risk or there is a problem with a foetus. If there is a chance the foetus can survive outside the womb, termination is lawful only if pregnancy or delivery is a serious risk to the woman's health. More on abortion in Europe.

In social media posts, it highlights systematic corruption - including nepotism and bribery - while presenting itself as a provider of security, justice and welfare. It also plugs into a sense of discrimination felt by Sunni groups, and suggests the West and its allies are complicit in the corruption. What's more, corruption has physically weakened some forces - like the Iraqi army, which did not have enough soldiers to combat IS when it first attacked Mosul because thousands of people were being paid, but not actually working. Ms Dixon warns this means that without addressing the problem at the highest level IS will not be defeated. In particular, Ms Dixon - who co-authored the report - said \"what we shouldn't be doing is putting western taxpayers' money into helping create exploitative, predatory state forces\". \"This is not just about closing off the corrupt channels that enable the day-to-day operations of groups like IS, but rethinking relationships with the Mubaraks [in Egypt], Gaddafis [in Libya] and Malakis [in Iraq] of the future,\" said Ms Dixon. \"Corruption is a real security threat, more than just a means for elites to line their pockets.

Droudis's boyfriend, Man Haron Monis, took 18 people hostage in a Lindt cafe in central Sydney in 2014. The 16-hour siege ended with the deaths of Monis and two hostages when police stormed the building. Monis had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's killing, and was on bail at the time of the siege. The Supreme Court of New South Wales heard that Monis planned the 2013 murder and Droudis carried it out. The victim, identified by the pseudonym Helen Lee, was stabbed 18 times before being doused in petrol and set alight outside an apartment in western Sydney. After the trial, Justice Peter Johnson ruled that Monis recruited Droudis to murder his ex-wife. \"The offender uncritically adopted and espoused Monis's foul beliefs and acted in public support of him in public protests,\" he said in his sentencing remarks on Wednesday. The judge described Monis as \"an evil man\" whose death was \"a result of his own criminal and murderous acts\". \"No-one mourns his passing and many have been left to grapple the consequences of his destructive acts,\" he said. The judge acknowledged claims that Droudis had been repeatedly assaulted by Monis. Droudis was sentenced to a maximum 44 years in jail with a non-parole period of 33 years. Detective Inspector Jason Dickinson, who worked on the case, said he was satisfied with the sentence handed to Droudis. \"This was a brutal and callous crime and I think the sentence today has reflected that brutality,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

The watchdog inspected 22 schools in England which had previously been inspected by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate. Inspectors found that nine of these schools were inadequate. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has written to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 15 Muslim and seven Christian schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester. Previous checks of these private faith schools had been carried out by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate (BSI), an independent inspectorate which had inspected about 50 private Muslim and Christian schools. Independent schools do not come under the same Ofsted process as state schools, with inspections being carried out by independent agencies such as the Independent Schools Inspectorate and the School Inspection Service. Ofsted had raised concerns about the \"quality of BSI inspection\" and, this autumn, Ofsted took over its inspection responsibilities. One school in this current wave of Ofsted inspections - Manchester Islamic High School for Girls - was rated outstanding. But Sir Michael's letter highlights a range of concerns about other schools previously inspected by BSI. Four of the schools were assessed not to be \"promoting fundamental British values\". This included not promoting \"mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\". There were concerns about a lack of exposure to other religions and \"inappropriate\" books. At Al Ameen primary school in Birmingham, inspectors say pupils were not protected from reading \"inappropriate literature about extremist, sexist or partisan views\". Inspectors said that at Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, \"the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. \"As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. \"A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women.\" This school, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as \"forward thinking\". Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system. In Cornerstone School in Epsom, a private Christian school, Ofsted said pupils were \"not given sufficient opportunities to learn about different cultures and the perspectives of others\". There were eight schools where there were safeguarding concerns, including \"not paying due regard to the guidance issued in 'Keeping children safe in education', a lack of checks on staff or insufficient records on pupil attendance. And in a further 10 cases there were concerns about schools not providing a sufficiently broad curriculum.

The skins are arrays of small pressure sensors that convert tiny changes in pressure into electrical signals. The arrays are built into or under flexible rubber sheets that could be stretched into a variety of shapes. The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects. They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery. In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet. Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top. The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow. The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance. \"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach. The heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers. \"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News. \"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added. The overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed. Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high. Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques. John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials. \"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote. However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.", "qas": [{"question": "What can the flexible rubber skins feel ?", "answers": [], "id": 9560}, {"question": "What can the flexible rubber skins sense ?", "answers": [], "id": 9561}, {"question": "What kind of skin technology has US scientists developed ?", "answers": [], "id": 9562}, {"question": "What has been developed by US scientists ?", "answers": [], "id": 9563}, {"question": "What can the flexible skins sense ?", "answers": [], "id": 9564}, {"question": "What country developed flexible rubber skins ?", "answers": [], "id": 9565}, {"question": "What are used by scientists to feel pressure ?", "answers": [], "id": 9566}, {"question": "Who developed flexible rubber skins for humans ?", "answers": [], "id": 9567}, {"question": "What kind of skin technology did US scientists develop ?", "answers": [], "id": 9568}, {"question": "What can the flexible rubber on gloves sense ?", "answers": [], "id": 9569}]}], "title": "The materials, which can sense"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "It said a detailed, time-bound plan for implementation should be outlined as the move could improve safety and efficiency.

WAO director David Thomas said a number of the NHS staff auditors spoken to cited \"frustration\" that it was taking so long to bring in an electronic prescribing system in Wales. He said implementing one would result in a \"much more effective and efficient system within hospitals\". The report also looked at other areas of prescribing and found there were some safety issues caused by incomplete medicine information on paper drug charts, including some which did not have information about patients' drug allergies. There were also some instances where notes were unclear about whether patients had received the doses they were due. The report also looked at how new medicines were chosen and although there is a national process for appraising new drugs, it found there were three instances where decisions had been taken outside that process. The WAO would not provide details of the cases, but Mr Thomas said where new drugs are given there needed to be very clear reasons for doing so. The report also found that while NHS Wales was taking steps to improve prescribing in the community, there was scope to further improve quality and costs.

The UN Security Council expressed its opposition after an emergency meeting.

The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the \"safety-valve\" clause. The recommendation for \"general prohibition\" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances \"where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\". The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban. The coalition government response last October went along with the safety-valve clause saying it would \"explore how to put in place a schedule of exemptions and make provision to add to these where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\". But when the new Conservative government published the Psychoactive Substances Bill last month, any mention of assessing social harms or health risks had gone. The safety-valve clause insisted upon by the expert panel had been removed. The Home Office has made it clear that \"there is no provision in the Bill to enable the licensing of so-called low-harm substances\" arguing that there are difficulties in defining low risk and that it might \"send out confusing messages about the safety of new psychoactive substances\". It is likely that this is going to be a major battleground as the controversial bill reaches committee stage in Parliament. The LibDem Home Affairs spokesman Lord Paddick has made it clear his party will oppose the legislation in its current form. \"As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm,\" he told the House of Lords. The Bill would ban any substance that affects a consumer's \"mental functioning or emotional state\", unless specifically exempted by the Home Secretary. This definition goes further than the Irish legislation on which the approach is modelled. In Ireland, a psychoactive substance is defined as one that results in \"a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood\". The word \"significant\" is, of course, significant. It provides the safety valve that excludes low-risk and low-harm products.

Williams driver Valtteri Bottas said the team had found a problem with the \"rim clearance\" - the distance between the wheel and the wheel assembly - and that he had had the same problem as Massa but had been \"more lucky\". \"If there is something under the rim too close, that can cause problems,\" the Finn said. Both Massa's failures happened on his first lap out of the pits on the entry to the Turn Six hairpin. On the first, Massa was pitched into a spin. On the second, he did not lose control, but the tyre appeared to simply pop off the rim. There were no clear television pictures of the failure on Magnussen's car.

The school, which charges up to \u00c2\u00a36,790 a term, has also been encouraged to allow unisex toilets and open all sports to all pupils. Girls at the school can wear grey trousers, dark blue jackets and ties. But boys are not currently allowed to wear grey pleated skirts, although they would be under the new proposed dress code. \"We are asking them, should it be called uniform number one and uniform number two?,\" said head Adam Pettitt. He said the issue of a gender neutral uniform had come up during question and answer sessions with his A-Level students. This generation of young people was really questioning the binary way people look at things, he said. \"We're therefore exploring how our uniform policy could evolve to cater for those who do want to match clothing to gender, as well as those who don't.\" He added: \"In common with all other schools and youth organisations, yes, we are seeing greater numbers of pupils questioning gender identity than in the past. \"Having said that, in years gone by, absolutely no young people were raising it at all and it seems inconceivable that these sorts of questions simply didn't exist. \"The fact that there is significantly greater support and information available, both in schools and elsewhere, means that young people need no longer feel afraid to ask questions or speak out about their feelings. \"If they feel happier and more secure in who they are, it must be a good thing,\" he said. Mr Pettitt said parents would be consulted before changes were introduced, but acknowledged that some former pupils had written to complain the school was \"promoting the wrong ideas\". Co-educational independent boarding school Brighton College, where Mr Pettitt is a governor, has introduced a similarly gender neutral uniform. Student equality groups have called for teachers to observe gender neutral speech codes and for a ban on phrases such as \"man up\". And figures show a sharp rise in the number of young people seeking help to change gender. Highgate School is holding a conference next month called The Developing Teenager which will examine how teachers should approach issues raised by transgender and gender neutral students. In 2011, 12-year-old boy Chris Whitehead wore a skirt to school because he was angered by rules at Impington Village College, near Cambridge, that did not allow boys to wear shorts in hot weather. The Year 8 pupil said he researched the policy, found a loophole in the rules and turned up to school in a skirt. The school pledged to review the policy.

Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than \u00c2\u00a3450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber.

Head of state, prime minister: King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud. The Al Saud dynasty holds a monopoly of political power. Saudi Arabia was established in 1932 by King Abd-al-Aziz and he has been succeeded by various sons. King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud ascended the throne in January 2015 following the death of his half-brother, King Abdullah. He has been part of the ruling clique of princes for decades and is thought likely to continue the main thrusts of Saudi strategic policy, including maintaining the alliance with the United States and working towards energy market stability. Saudi investors are major players in the pan-Arab TV industry, but the country has one of the region's most tightly-controlled media environments. The government openly acknowledges that widespread internet filtering takes place. It targets \"pornographic\", Islam-related, human rights and political sites. Saudi Arabia has the highest per-capita YouTube use of any country in the world. It is reportedly home to more than 40% of all active Twitter users in the Arab region. Some key events in Saudi Arabia's history:. 1932 - The areas controlled by King Abd-al-Aziz are unified under the name Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 1938 - Oil is discovered and production begins under the US-controlled Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company). 1960 - Saudi Arabia is a founding member of Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries). 1973 - Saudi Arabia leads an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the October War against Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadruple. 2001 11 September - 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in attacks on New York and Washington are Saudi nationals. 2011 - As ''Arab Spring'' protests ripple across the region, Saudi troops participate in crackdown on unrest in Bahrain. 2015 March - Saudi Arabia launches campaign of air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.", "qas": [{"question": "What is one of the most powerful countries in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9870}, {"question": "What country is one of the most powerful in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9871}, {"question": "Which is one of the most powerful countries in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9872}, {"question": "Which country is one of the most powerful in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9873}, {"question": "Which country is one of the most powerful countries in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9874}, {"question": "What is the strongest country in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9875}, {"question": "What is one of the strongest countries in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9876}, {"question": "Saudi Arabia is one of what kind of countries ?", "answers": [], "id": 9877}, {"question": "What is the most powerful country in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9878}, {"question": "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of what in the world ?", "answers": [], "id": 9879}]}], "title": "Its stature is built on"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The East Superleague side fell behind when Paul Quinn fired in from a corner for his second goal in two games. Rose drew level through a Jamie Reckord own goal, but Graham and Alex Schalk put the Premiership side in control. However, the semi-professionals refused to buckle and Ruari MacLennan scored his fourth cup goal before Graham pounced to finally settle the tie. While County move into the quarter-final draw, the first junior side to reach the last 16 of the competition were far from disgraced. It is an indication of the strength of his squad that County manager Jim McIntyre was able to make six changes to the side that beat Celtic in last week's League Cup semi final. There was certainly no sign of disruption early on as the Premiership outfit raced into the lead in their first serious attack after a bright start by the visitors. Colin Leiper nearly headed Ian McShane's corner into his own net with Ryan Baptie clearing off the line, but the ball broke to Quinn, who hammered home from 12 yards for his second goal since his return from Aberdeen. Many would have expected the Rose to wilt after that fourth-minute setback, but they showed real character to take the game to the Staggies and create a couple of decent chances. Conor Kelly fired a shot over the bar from the edge of the box then Tommy Coyne swapped passes with Graham Weir before forcing Gary Woods into a save from a similar distance. County's main threat continued to be from set pieces, with Quinn and Raffa De Vita going close, while Linlithgow goalkeeper Ally Adams made an outstanding diving save low to his left to prevent Brian Graham converting Jonathan Franks' inviting cross. Rose have shown resilience throughout their Scottish Cup adventure and, after Ruari McLennan then Blair Batchelor had shots blocked, Scott Boyd blasted it off the goal-line against Reckord and into the empty net to spark wild celebrations among the Rose players and their large travelling support. They continued to give as good as they got at the start of the second half, with Batchelor forcing Woods into a save, but the Premiership side's superiority at set pieces paid off. McShane whipped in another corner from the left and Graham raced clear to head home from six yards. Schalk finally killed off the tie five minutes later as Jackson Irvine found space in the box to head on for the Dutchman to slam the ball in from close range. Back came the junior side with a slick passing move climaxed by MacLennan's finish in 75 minutes only for the Staggies to spoil any chance of a fairytale finish.

John Kelly, whose brother was one of 14 Bloody Sunday victims killed by soldiers who opened fire on a civil rights march in Derry in 1972, had described the original plan as \"an act of pure provocation\".

Last week, march organiser Anto Wickham said the aim of the event was to protect soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan facing \"false prosecutions\". Mr Wickham said he was \"upset\" by suggestions that the Derry march had been planned to raise tensions in the city. He told Tuesday's Belfast Telegraph: \"With help from the Royal British Legion in Coleraine, we are now able to parade and carry on our fight for justice\".

The communication process, where you swap messages, was quite antiquated, and we've made it much more like text, immediate and very easy.\" While Donald Trump may have got those looking for love logging in, has that other first-date conversational taboo - Brexit - had much of an impact on eHarmony and its choice of European headquarters? \"For now we're ok with [our London office],\" Mr Lagston says, though he adds, \"there is always a chance we could move it to Frankfurt or some such place.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What has thrown the world 's politics into turmoil ?", "answers": [], "id": 9970}, {"question": "What has thrown the world politics into turmoil ?", "answers": [], "id": 9971}, {"question": "What has Donald Trump become president thrown into turmoil ?", "answers": [], "id": 9972}, {"question": "In what country was Donald Trump elected president ?", "answers": [], "id": 9973}, {"question": "What has Donald Trump 's election thrown into turmoil ?", "answers": [], "id": 9974}, {"question": "What position did Donald Trump win election to ?", "answers": [], "id": 9975}, {"question": "What has thrown the world polity into turmoil ?", "answers": [], "id": 9976}, {"question": "What role did Donald Trump win election to ?", "answers": [], "id": 9977}, {"question": "Who was elected president of the United States ?", "answers": [], "id": 9978}, {"question": "What has Donald Trump become President thrown into turmoil ?", "answers": [], "id": 9979}]}], "title": "And it seems there's been"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Lancashire batsman Livingstone, who scored 129 from 83 balls for England Lions against South Africa A last week, is one of five uncapped players named.

England lost their last Twenty20 series 2-1 to India in February. Moeen Ali, Jake Ball, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Ben Stokes have been rested and will instead play for their respective counties in the inaugural day-night round of the County Championship, which starts on 26 June. This will allow them to gain experience of playing with the pink Dukes balls that will be used for the first day-night Test to be played in England, against West Indies at Edgbaston in August. Sussex fast bowler Tymal Mills, meanwhile, has been ruled out with a back injury, but Durham seamer Mark Wood returns after missing the India series through injury. Middlesex opener Malan, Surrey paceman Curran and Somerset all-rounder Overton have previously been included in England squads, while Hampshire leg-spinner Crane is called up after impressing in the North-South series in March. Overton will replace Wood in the squad after the first match, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow will be available for the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire. Jason Roy, who has managed just 18 runs in three innings for England in the ongoing Champions Trophy, is named in the squad. Chairman of selectors James Whitaker said: \"The squad has an exciting blend of youth and experience and we are looking forward to a competitive series against strong opposition. \"With five uncapped players selected, there is undoubted talent coming through the system and we are excited to see some of these players showcase their skills at the highest level.\" BBC Radio Lancashire's Scott Read.

Leaders in Lombardy, Liguria and Veneto warn they cannot accept more migrants. Italy is struggling with a huge surge in migration, with nearly 6,000 people rescued from the sea just this weekend. More than 50,000 people have arrived in Italy this year, most of them setting sail from Libya aboard unsafe vessels. More than 1,500 people have drowned while making the Mediterranean crossing this year. The deaths have prompted an EU effort to boost naval patrols off Libyan waters. The rescued migrants are brought ashore to centres throughout Italy, where they are expected to remain until their claims for asylum within the EU have been processed. Speaking to reporters after the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Renzi said the EU had to acknowledge that its current system for dealing with migrants was not working. \"What we need to do at the moment is solve problems, not by shouting but through action,\" he said. He also urged the EU to take in more refugees from Italy, saying a recent plan to relocate 24,000 refugees to other European countries was \"not enough\". The influx has put a severe strain on Italy's asylum infrastructure, and has fuelled support for right-wing politicians who oppose immigration. On Sunday, the president of Lombardy, Roberto Maroni, said his region would not take in any more migrants. He also threatened to cut funding for local authorities who continued to accept migrants. His stance was supported by Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto and a member of the Northern League. He was also backed by Giovanni Toti, the newly-elected president of the Liguria region and a member of Forza Italia. The three northern regions are among the most affluent in Italy, and have so far accommodated around 15% of the latest migrant influx. Sicily, a relatively poor southern region with high unemployment, has accommodated 22%. Italy's government predicts a total of 200,000 migrants will arrive on its shores this year, up from 170,000 in 2014.", "qas": [{"question": "What did Italy 's prime minister call on the EU to help with ?", "answers": [], "id": 9990}, {"question": "Who called on the European Union to do more to help deal with the migrant crisis ?", "answers": [], "id": 9991}, {"question": "What country has called on the European Union to do more to help deal with migrant crisis ?", "answers": [], "id": 9992}, {"question": "What did Italy 's prime minister want the European Union to help with ?", "answers": [], "id": 9993}, {"question": "Who did Italy 's prime minister want to help with the migrant crisis ?", "answers": [], "id": 9994}, {"question": "What does the prime minister want to help deal with ?", "answers": [], "id": 9995}, {"question": "Who did Italy 's prime minister call upon to help with the migrant crisis ?", "answers": [], "id": 9996}, {"question": "What did Italy 's prime minister call on the European Union to help with ?", "answers": [], "id": 9997}, {"question": "What country has called on the European Union to do more to deal with the migrant crisis ?", "answers": [], "id": 9998}, {"question": "Who asked the EU to do more to help deal with the migrant crisis ?", "answers": [], "id": 9999}]}], "title": "Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said"}]}
